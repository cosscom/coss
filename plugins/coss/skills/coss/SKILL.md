description: Build with coss.com (transactional and marketing email, SMS, webhooks, Hooks and Risk) through its SDKs and API. Use when adding coss.com to a project or changing code that uses it, when the user mentions coss.com, the `coss` package or COSS_API_KEY, or asks to send email or SMS, receive webhooks or check sign-ups with coss.com.

# Building with coss.com

coss.com is one API key and one SDK for email, SMS, Hooks (webhooks your app sends to its own
users) and Risk (sign-up, login and payment risk decisions). Its docs are written for agents too:
read them instead of guessing field names, error codes or webhook payloads.

## Read the docs first

- https://coss.com/llms.txt opens with a short brief and lists every docs page.
- Every docs page is Markdown at its URL plus `.md`, e.g. https://coss.com/docs/email/sending.md.
  API reference pages (`https://coss.com/docs/api-reference/<resource>/<operation>.md`) give the
  method and URL, every parameter and body field, the responses and errors, and examples in
  TypeScript, HTTP, Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, Java and .NET.
- With the coss MCP server connected, `search_docs` finds the page and `read_docs` reads it.

## Get a development key

Run `npx coss-cli init` in the project's directory, and tell the user to expect a browser window:
it opens the coss.com dashboard, where they sign in and approve a key for this project (it waits up
to 5 minutes). The key is written to `.env.local` (Next.js) or `.env` as `COSS_API_KEY`, and the
`coss` package is installed in JavaScript projects. If the env file already has `COSS_API_KEY`,
it's kept: check it starts with `coss_test_` (a `coss_live_` key delivers for real; `--force`
replaces it). Where no browser can open (over SSH, in a container or a cloud sandbox) the command
prints a link and waits for a code typed into the terminal: ask the user to run it themselves.
It adds a short coss.com section to the project's AGENTS.md for later sessions (`--no-agents`
skips that) and prints the one next step for this key. When the project already uses Nodemailer,
Better Auth, Auth.js, Laravel, Rails or Django, that message points at the drop-in.

Develop and test only with this key. Development keys (`coss_test_…`) work with every API and
record every email and SMS with their events and webhooks, but deliver nothing; the simulator
addresses (`bounce@simulator.amazonses.com`, `complaint@simulator.amazonses.com`, …) and numbers
produce failures to test against (https://coss.com/docs/environments.md). Never ask for a live key
(`coss_live_…`) to try something: going live (a verified domain, a registered number, a production
key) is the user's step, in the dashboard.

## Write the code

- TypeScript: `import { Coss } from "coss"`; `new Coss()` reads `COSS_API_KEY`. Create the client
  in server code only; the key must never reach a browser bundle.
- Every SDK method returns `{ data, error }` and never throws for API or network failures. Check
  `error` (`type`, `code`, `message`, `hint` when it names the fix, `issues` for validation
  errors) on every call.
- Retries are automatic, with an `Idempotency-Key` on every POST; pass your own
  (`{ idempotencyKey }`) when a retry of your own code could send twice.
- Other languages (Python `cosscom`, Go, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET):
  https://coss.com/docs/sdks.md. Nodemailer, Better Auth, Auth.js, Laravel, Rails and Django:
  https://coss.com/docs/integrations.md. Anything that speaks SMTP:
  https://coss.com/docs/email/smtp.md.

## Webhooks

- Verify every request with `verifyWebhook(rawBody, headers, secret)` from `coss` before using
  it: pass the raw body as received; it throws on a bad signature
  (https://coss.com/docs/sdk/webhooks.md). Event types and payloads:
  https://coss.com/docs/webhooks.md.
- Handlers must be idempotent (the `webhook-id` header is the event's id) and not depend on
  ordering (use `data.occurred_at`).
- To test locally: `npx coss-cli login` once (the user approves it like `init`), then
  `npx coss-cli listen --forward-to localhost:3000/<path>` forwards the environment's events to
  the handler. It writes `COSS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` into the same env file as the key (an existing
  value is kept) and prints it. `npx coss-cli webhooks add <url>` (or the MCP tool
  `create_webhook_endpoint`) registers that URL, writes the endpoint's secret into the same
  variable (replacing a listen secret so both sign the same way) and does not create a second
  endpoint for a URL that already has one. `npx coss-cli trigger <event type>` sends a sample event.
- `publish_email_template` publishes the draft at the revision you read. Sends use that version
  from then on. `push_email_template` only updates the draft.

## Check what happened

- `npx coss-cli logs tail` follows the environment's API requests and events.
- `npx coss-cli emails diagnose <email id>` (or `--to <address>`) explains a delivery.
- The MCP server's `get_setup` says what to do next with this key. `diagnose_email`,
  `diagnose_sms` and `search_logs` answer what happened. It reads a `coss_test_` key from the
  project env file when `COSS_API_KEY` is unset, and never loads a `coss_live_` key from that file.
