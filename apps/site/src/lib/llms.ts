> One API key and one SDK for transactional and marketing email, inboxes for AI agents, SMS, Verify (one-time codes by SMS or email), Hooks (webhooks as a service for your own users) and Risk (sign-up, login and payment risk decisions). These docs are written for people and coding agents alike.

## Reading these docs

- Every page is Markdown at its URL plus \`.md\`, as linked below (the docs home is ${link("/docs")}). Fetch the pages you need rather than guessing.
- API reference pages (${SITE_URL}/docs/api-reference/…) give each operation's method and URL, parameters, request body, responses and errors, with TypeScript, HTTP, Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, Java and .NET examples. The OpenAPI 3.1 document is https://api.coss.com/openapi.json.
- ${SITE_URL}/llms-full.txt is every guide in one file, with one short entry per API operation.
- Claude Code plugin, an Agent Skill for other agents, and the MCP server: ${link("/docs/agents")}.

## Adding coss.com to a project

1. **Get a development API key.** In the project's directory, run \`npx coss-cli init\` and tell the user to expect a browser window: it opens the coss.com dashboard, where they sign in and approve a key for this project (it waits up to 5 minutes). It then writes the key to \`.env.local\` (Next.js) or \`.env\` as \`COSS_API_KEY\`, and installs the \`coss\` package in JavaScript projects. A key already in that file is kept: check it starts with \`coss_test_\` (\`--force\` replaces it). Where no browser can open (over SSH, in a container or a cloud sandbox) it prints a link and waits for a code typed into the terminal, so ask the user to run it there themselves. It writes a short version of these notes into the project's AGENTS.md (\`--no-agents\` skips that) and prints the one next step for this key, including the drop-in when the project already uses Nodemailer, Better Auth, Auth.js, Laravel, Rails or Django. See ${link("/docs/cli")}.
2. **Build and test with that key.** Development keys (\`coss_test_…\`) work with every API, record every email and SMS with their events and webhooks, and deliver nothing; the simulator addresses and numbers produce bounces, complaints and failures (${link("/docs/environments")}). Never ask for a live key (\`coss_live_…\`) to develop with: going live (a verified domain, a registered number, a production key) is the user's step, in the dashboard.
3. **Use the SDK.** TypeScript: \`import { Coss } from "coss"\`; \`new Coss()\` reads \`COSS_API_KEY\`. Every method returns \`{ data, error }\` and never throws for API or network failures, so check \`error\` (\`type\`, \`code\`, \`message\`, and \`hint\` when it names the fix); retries are automatic and safe (an \`Idempotency-Key\` on every POST). See ${link("/docs/quickstart")} and ${link("/docs/sdk")}. Python, Go, Ruby, PHP, Java and .NET SDKs: ${link("/docs/sdks")}. Nodemailer, Better Auth, Auth.js, Laravel, Rails and Django: ${link("/docs/integrations")}. An agent that needs its own email address gets one with \`coss.inboxes.create()\`: mail to it arrives as threads with an \`inbox.message.received\` webhook, and it replies with \`coss.inboxes.messages.reply()\` (${link("/docs/inboxes")}).
4. **Receive webhooks.** Verify every request with \`verifyWebhook(rawBody, headers, secret)\`, which throws on a bad signature (${link("/docs/sdk/webhooks")}; events: ${link("/docs/webhooks")}). Locally, \`npx coss-cli listen --forward-to localhost:3000/<path>\` forwards the environment's events to the handler and writes \`COSS_WEBHOOK_SECRET\` into the same env file as the key. \`npx coss-cli webhooks add <url>\` registers an endpoint and writes that secret (replacing a listen secret, so both sign the same way). \`npx coss-cli trigger <event type>\` sends a sample one. These commands use the CLI's own sign-in (\`npx coss-cli login\`, approved like \`init\`) or \`COSS_API_KEY\` in their environment.
5. **Check what happened.** \`npx coss-cli logs tail\` follows the environment's API requests and events, and \`npx coss-cli emails diagnose <id>\` explains a delivery. The MCP server (\`npx -y coss-mcp\`, ${link("/docs/mcp")}) reads a development key from the project env file when its own environment has none. Call \`get_setup\` before writing send code, and \`diagnose_email\` to explain a delivery. It also searches these docs.
