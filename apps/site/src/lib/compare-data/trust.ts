      question: "Can coss.com Risk protect a mobile app?",
      answer:
        "Your server can assess events from any client, using the email, IP, user and velocity signals. There's no native device SDK: coss/device is browser-only. Castle has iOS, Android, React Native and Flutter SDKs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does coss.com Risk cover payments?",
      answer:
        "Yes. A checkout event takes the amount and what your processor knows about the card: its fingerprint, country and funding. coss.com compares countries, counts checkouts per card, and remembers cards you report as fraud. It never takes a card number.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if a signal is slow or unavailable?",
      answer:
        "The assessment is made without it, and the missing group is listed in degraded. If the API can't be reached at all, your code decides, and the docs recommend failing open.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does coss.com share fraud data between customers?",
      answer:
        "No. What an environment remembers for velocity, duplicates and fraud reports stays in that environment, as keyed hashes. Castle's scoring draws on crowd-wide statistics.",
