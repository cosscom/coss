    Just as suddenly as it had begun, the sensation stopped, leaving Alice
    feeling slightly disoriented. She looked around and realized that the room
    hadn't changed at all - it was she who had grown smaller, shrinking down to
    a fraction of her previous size. Alice felt herself growing larger and
    larger, filling up the entire room until she feared she might burst. The
    sensation was both thrilling and terrifying, as if she were expanding beyond
    the confines of her own body. She wondered if this was what it felt like to
    be a balloon, swelling with air until it could hold no more.
  </div>
</ScrollArea>
