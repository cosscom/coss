description: Current state of coss ui and where we’re headed next.
---

**coss ui** is the evolution of **Origin UI**, an open-source collection of React and Tailwind components created by Pasquale Vitiello and Davide Pacilio. It was recently **acquired by Cal.com** and grown into a broader, more ambitious ecosystem, with Pasquale contributing directly to the development of the new UI.

Our goal is to **bring together the best parts of Origin UI** with a stronger foundation—Base UI primitives—so developers get not just components, but a layered system of **primitives**, **particles**, and **atoms**.

## Origin UI

Origin UI offered a large collection of 600+ ready-to-use UI components. With the **transition to coss ui**:

- The existing **Origin UI components** will evolve into **particles**—higher-level UI patterns composed of Base UI primitives.
- The original Origin UI collection remains available on [this page](/origin), so developers can continue to access it during the transition.

## Current Status

- **40+ UI primitives** already available, with more on the way.
- A **growing set of particles**, progressively expanding to match and surpass the current Origin UI collection.

## What’s Next

- Expand the **primitives set**, ensuring full coverage of common UI needs.
- Add more **particles**, aligning with and eventually replacing the original Origin UI collection.
- Introduce **atoms**, API-enhanced components that bring external integrations out of the box.
