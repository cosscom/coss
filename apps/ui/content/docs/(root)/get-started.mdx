This guide provides the essentials for adding **coss ui** components to your React application.

## Prerequisites

Our components are built with [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com). Before you begin, make sure you have a React project set up with Tailwind CSS.

## Adding Components

You can add components **automatically with the shadcn CLI** or **manually by copying the files**. Both methods work for primitives, particles, and atoms.

### With the CLI

Each component page provides a command to add it to your project automatically. The CLI will create the necessary files and install any dependencies for you.

### Manually

1.  **Find a component** on the [Components](/ui/docs) or [Particles](/ui/particles) pages.
2.  **Copy the code** from the **Code** tab.
3.  **Create a new file** in your project (e.g., `components/ui/button.tsx`) and paste the code.
4.  **Install any dependencies** listed on the component's page.
5.  **Import and use** the component in your app.

## Styling

Components are styled with the design token system we use at **Cal.com**, which is defined by CSS variables and implemented with Tailwind CSS.

The variables are the same as shadcn/ui, and are fully customizable. You can modify them in your global stylesheet (e.g., `app/globals.css`) to match your design system.

We've introduced a few additional tokens to provide more granular control:

- `--destructive-foreground`: Used for destructive-outline buttons, destructive menu items, badges, and field errors
- `--info` and `--info-foreground`: Commonly used for info-colored badges, toast types, and alerts
- `--success` and `--success-foreground`: Used for success-colored badges, toast types, and alerts
- `--warning` and `--warning-foreground`: Used for warning-colored badges, toast types, and alerts

**Important**: If you manually import components, you must also import these additional tokens in your CSS file (e.g., `app/globals.css`). However, if you use the CLI to import components, these tokens will be automatically imported and configured for you.

## Migration from Radix UI

For developers migrating from **Radix UI**, many of our **UI primitives** include instructions and examples for translating equivalent Radix components to Base UI. This ensures a smooth transition while preserving accessibility, behaviors, and API patterns.

## Working with LLMs

We structure the documentation to make the components **AI-friendly**, so language models can understand, reason about, and modify them. To support this, we include:

- A [llms.txt](/ui/llms.txt) file that provides a map of the documentation and component structure for your AI agent.
- A **Copy Markdown** button on every page, so you can easily share content or feed it to your AI workflows.
