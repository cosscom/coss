The drawer needs to leave enough room for actions beside each bubble, keep the composer comfortable to use, and make long notes like this one easy to skim. If anything feels crowded, we can simplify it before sharing the pattern with other teams.",

We should check whether the reading position stays predictable, whether the latest message control is easy to find, and whether the date markers still make sense as we move through older parts of the conversation. If you notice any confusing transitions, leave a note so we can refine the behavior before this pattern is reused elsewhere in the app.",
