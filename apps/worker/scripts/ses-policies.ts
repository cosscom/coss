/**
 * Least-privilege IAM policies for the apps when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses`, created by `ses:bootstrap`
 * as customer-managed policies to attach to whatever identity each app runs as.
 *
 * Identities coss.com creates are tagged `coss_managed=<tenant prefix>`; destructive identity operations
 * are only allowed on identities with that tag, so domains managed outside coss.com in the same account
 * (e.g. the company's own) can't be changed or deleted by the apps. Sending can't be limited by tag:
 * SES authorizes `SendEmail` against the sender *address* (`identity/hello@acme.com`), which is not
 * a tagged resource. Sends are confined by the configuration sets instead (verified live: another
 * configuration set, or none so the identity's default applies, is denied), and the app always
 * sends with a `<prefix>-…` tenant, which SES only allows with identities associated with it.
 * Each stream has its configuration set (`<name>`, `<name>-marketing`); both are allowed.
 * Dedicated IPs add one managed pool per organization and a configuration set per stream sending
 * through it, named `<prefix>-<organization id>[-marketing]` and tagged `coss_managed`; only the
 * worker manages them.
