# AGENTS.md — coss.com monorepo

coss.com is a unified developer platform: one API key + one SDK (`coss.email.send()`, `coss.sms.send()`, later
video, scheduling…). This repo holds the dashboard, the public API, shared packages and the public SDK.
Email delivery goes through the provider interface in `packages/email/src/provider.ts` (Amazon SES v2 with one SES
tenant per organization, or the fake provider); sandbox environments always use the fake provider. Delivery events
drive per-recipient status and signed customer webhooks. Environments also receive email (an SES receipt rule → S3 +
SQS → the worker; see `packages/email/AGENTS.md`), and **inboxes** give AI agents their own addresses there, with
received mail kept as threads and replies sent from the address (`coss.inboxes`). A sample of live messages is screened by an AI decision model
(`@coss/screening`) before it is sent. SMS (`@coss/sms`) goes through Twilio — Cal.com's ISV account, one subaccount
per organization, US A2P 10DLC and toll-free registration of each organization's numbers — with status and inbound
callbacks to the API (`/sms/twilio/*`); see `packages/sms/AGENTS.md`. Plans, contracts, metered usage, credits and invoices are `@coss/billing`
(coss.com rates usage itself; Stripe, behind a provider interface, only collects). Rate limits (per API key, per-org send quotas, dashboard
auth) are counted in Valkey (ElastiCache Serverless in production) by `@coss/ratelimit`. Errors and traces go to
Sentry (organization `cosscom`) through `@coss/observability`. coss.com Risk (`@coss/risk`, `coss.risk.assess()`) assesses customers' sign-ups, logins and other
events: email/IP signals (`@coss/signals`), content scores, plus what each environment remembers (velocity in Valkey,
duplicate mailboxes, fraud reports, allow/block lists) and its rules become `allow`/`review`/`block` with reasons; the
signals are also building blocks of their own, next to rate limiting as a service (`coss.risk.limit()`). Forms
(`@coss/forms`, `coss.forms`) are hosted form endpoints on a domain of their own (`/f/<id>`, served by the API):
every submission is screened by Risk (honeypot, assessment, content check, captcha) and accepted ones go to
webhooks, notification emails and contacts, optionally after the submitter confirms by email; see
`packages/forms/AGENTS.md`. Scheduling (`@coss/scheduling`, `coss.scheduling`) lets customers' users be booked: hosts, weekly hours, Google, Microsoft and CalDAV calendars (each host's own, or a whole domain's through a calendar delegation), and bookings, enforced by a Postgres exclusion constraint; see `packages/scheduling/AGENTS.md`. Support (`@coss/support`) is coss.com's own desk: customers email `support@coss.com` or raise a ticket in the dashboard, reps answer from the admin console, with per-plan targets; see `packages/support/AGENTS.md`. Human setup docs (incl. running on SES): [README.md](./README.md).

`coss/device`'s token (turbo builds the SDK before the dashboard's `dev`/`build` too).

Single package: `bun run --cwd <pkg> test [filter]` (after `bun run db:migrate:test` once). Don't run bare `bun test`
from the root or a package — the package script is what loads `.env` and the test-DB preload.

**Before pushing**, run `bun run verify` (`git fetch origin main` first): lint, then typecheck and tests of the
packages your change reaches (`turbo --affected` against `origin/main`). Don't run the whole suite locally: CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, Postgres 18, no `.env`, on Blacksmith's runners) does that in the merge queue. Only the
queue lands commits on main (main's ruleset; its one required check is CI's `ci` job). Pull requests get quick
feedback (lint, then typecheck, tests and builds of the affected packages), and the queue runs those for every
package on the exact commit main becomes. Both run an SDK's or driver's jobs only when its own directory, the API's
contract (`apps/api/openapi.json`, `apps/api/test/serve.ts`), its conformance files or the workflow changed; a
nightly run on main checks all of them (a failure there is a regression to fix first). Merge with `gh pr merge <number>` (no method flag): it joins the queue, or waits for the
pull request's checks first; `--admin` would skip the queue — never use it. A pull request leaves the queue when
its run fails: read the merge group's run (`gh run list --workflow ci.yml --event merge_group`), fix, push, merge
again. After changing `integrations/<driver>` also run its own lint and tests (CI's `integrations` job): `composer
lint && composer test` (Laravel), `bundle exec rubocop && bundle exec rake test` (Rails), `uv run ruff check && uv
run ruff format --check && uv run pytest` (Django); their end-to-end tests run when `COSS_E2E` holds the line `bun
run --cwd apps/api serve:test` prints.

**Security scanning** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`): CodeQL analyzes the TypeScript and the workflows, and `bun
audit` checks dependencies for high-severity advisories, on pull requests, on main and weekly. CodeQL's findings are
in the repository's Security tab. Neither is a required check. Cal.com's SDLC policy (Drata) asks for this. The advisories
`bun audit` ignores are listed with their reasons in the workflow: only the iOS app's toolchain.

**Remote cache** (README, "Remote cache"): `typecheck` and `build` results are uploaded to Turbo's Vercel Remote Cache
(team `cal`, signed) and the merge queue replays any task whose hash it finds (pull request runs get no cache
credentials: whatever reads the signed cache can also write to it).
Each machine is set up once by a human (`turbo login`, `~/.config/coss/turbo.env` loaded from the shell profile). If
a `turbo` run's header says `Remote caching disabled` or `unavailable`, tell the user the machine isn't set up and
point them at that README section — never run `turbo login`, create Vercel tokens, or write `TURBO_*` values into
`.env`, a commit or a log yourself. Keep task outputs machine-independent and keep `globalEnv` to build-affecting
variables (`infra/test` enforces the list): a hash that differs between laptops and CI silently turns the cache off.

## Conventions

- **Wire format is snake_case** (`reply_to`, `created_at`); internal code is camelCase. The SDK's wire types are
  hand-written mirrors (`packages/sdk/src/types/*.ts`), checked against the zod schemas by `apps/api/test/contract-types.ts`
  (typecheck) and `apps/api/test/sdk-contract.test.ts` (built SDK vs. the in-process app). Change both sides together.
- **IDs are TypeIDs** stored as `text` (`<prefix>_<26-char base32 UUIDv7>`, e.g. `email_01k…`). Prefixes live in
  `ID_PREFIXES` (`packages/db/src/id.ts`; Better Auth's `invitation` → `invite`, `apikey` → `key`). Use
  `newId(ID_PREFIXES.x)` / `isId()` from `@coss/db/id`. Domain tables generate ids app-side (`$defaultFn`), so raw SQL
  inserts must supply one. Better Auth uses `generateAuthId` (`MODEL_ID_PREFIX` in `packages/auth/src/options.ts`) —
  a new Better Auth model needs an entry there or it falls back to `id_…`.
- Internal packages are **just-in-time TypeScript** (`exports` point at `.ts`, no build). Relative imports use explicit
  `.ts` extensions in `packages/*` and `apps/api`; `apps/web` uses extensionless imports and the `@/*` alias;
  `packages/ui` imports itself via `@coss/ui/*` (shadcn aliases). A new internal package used by the dashboard must be
  added to `transpilePackages` in `apps/web/next.config.ts`.
- Every workspace declares every dependency it imports or extends (Bun isolated linker). Versions shared by several
  workspaces live in the root `workspaces.catalog` (`"catalog:"`); single-use deps may pin directly. The SDK uses explicit
  versions mirroring the catalog (no `workspace:`/`catalog:`) — bump both together.
- Env: one root `.env` (copy `.env.example`). Package scripts load it with `--env-file=../../.env` (a missing file is a
  no-op, so real env vars win in CI/production; images never contain one, see `.dockerignore`); `process.loadEnvFile` loads it for Next (`apps/web/load-root-env.ts`,
  imported first by `next.config.ts`) and drizzle-kit (`packages/db/drizzle.config.ts`). Packages don't validate env but
  **read it at import time** (`@coss/db` builds its pool from `DATABASE_URL`; `@coss/auth/options` reads `BETTER_AUTH_*`),
  so load env before importing them. Apps validate with t3-env (`apps/api/src/env.ts` — imported only by `src/index.ts`;
  `apps/web/src/env.ts` — imported by `next.config.ts` for dev/build and by `src/instrumentation.ts` when a server
  starts: the standalone server never runs `next.config.ts`). No `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables: they are inlined at build
  time, and images are built once for every stage.
- Library docs matching the installed versions live in the consuming workspace's `node_modules` (isolated linker):
  Next `apps/web/node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (see `apps/web/AGENTS.md`), Base UI
  `packages/ui/node_modules/@base-ui/react/docs/`, Turborepo `node_modules/turbo/docs/` (block at the end of this file).
  Read them before relying on memory.

## Environment variables

| Var | Used by |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `@coss/db` pool, drizzle-kit, migrations; validated by api + web |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | must name a `*_test` database; swapped in by `@coss/db/testing`; `db:migrate:test` |
| `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` | optional pg pool size (default 10) |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (≥ 32 chars), `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | `packages/auth/src/options.ts` (base URL, trusted origin, invitation links); `BETTER_AUTH_URL` also `apps/worker` (dashboard links in notification emails) |
| `PORTAL_PUBLIC_URL` | api, web ("Open portal"): origin of the Hooks portal (`apps/portal`, its own registrable domain); portal session links point there. Default `http://localhost:3003` outside production |
| `SIGN_PUBLIC_URL` | api: origin of Sign's signing app (`apps/sign`, its own registrable domain); signing session links point there. Default `http://localhost:3004` outside production; unset in production → creating a session answers 503 |
| `SIGN_DOCUMENTS_BUCKET` | api, worker, sign: Sign's documents bucket (S3, with `AWS_REGION`; Terraform output `sign_documents_bucket`). Unset: the fake store (Postgres) outside production, Sign off in production |
| `SIGN_NOTIFICATIONS_FROM` | worker: coss.com's sender of Sign emails ("<requester> via coss.com") for environments without their own `email_from`, on a verified domain of `NOTIFICATIONS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`'s organization; default `NOTIFICATIONS_FROM`'s address. The worker also reads `SIGN_PUBLIC_URL` (emailed links) |
| `SIGN_SEALER`, `SIGN_SEAL_KMS_KEY_ID`, `SIGN_SEAL_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN`, `SIGN_TSA_URL` | worker: what seals Sign's completed documents (`local`, the default outside production: a self-signed key made at start; `kms`: the KMS key and its certificate chain, PEM leaf first, `\n` accepted; `csc`: the CA's cloud signing API, below) and an optional RFC 3161 TSA (B-T timestamps; production: DigiCert's). Unset in production: completions wait. Shape in `@coss/sign/env` |
| `SIGN_CSC_URL`, `SIGN_CSC_TOKEN_URL`, `SIGN_CSC_CLIENT_ID`, `SIGN_CSC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SIGN_CSC_USERNAME`, `SIGN_CSC_PASSWORD`, `SIGN_CSC_CREDENTIAL_ID`, `SIGN_CSC_TOTP_SECRET` | worker with `SIGN_SEALER=csc`: a Cloud Signature Consortium API (SSL.com eSigner eSealing: `https://cs.ssl.com/csc/v1`, token `https://login.ssl.com/oauth2/token`; sandbox `cs-try.ssl.com`, `oauth-sandbox.ssl.com`), its OAuth password grant (client id, optional secret, account, password), the credential, and a base64 TOTP secret only for credentials that want a one-time password. Production: the secret ones in the stage secret (else `unset_secrets`) |
| `FORMS_PUBLIC_URL` | api, worker, web: the origin forms are served on (`<it>/f/<id>`; a registrable domain of its own in production, routed to the api service, which then serves `/f/*` only for that host). Default `http://localhost:3001` outside production; unset in production → Forms is off (503 `forms_unavailable`) |
| `FORMS_FILES_BUCKET` | api, worker, web: Forms' uploads (S3, with `AWS_REGION`). Unset: the fake store (Postgres) outside production; in production forms refuse files |
| `FORMS_NOTIFICATIONS_FROM` | worker: coss.com's sender of form notifications ("<form name> via coss.com") for forms without their own `notifications.from`, on a verified domain of `NOTIFICATIONS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`'s organization; default `NOTIFICATIONS_FROM`'s address. Verification emails never use it |
| `SUPPORT_FILES_BUCKET` | web, worker: Support's ticket attachments (S3, with `AWS_REGION`; Terraform output `support_files_bucket`). Unset: the fake store (Postgres) outside production; in production tickets take no attachments |
| `SUPPORT_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, `SUPPORT_FROM_ADDRESS`, `SUPPORT_REPLY_DOMAIN` | worker: Support's mail, all three or none: a live environment of coss.com's own organization (never `NOTIFICATIONS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`'s: suppressions are per environment) whose received mail becomes tickets, the address customers see, and that environment's receiving domain replies go to. Unset: emails are printed outside production and wait in production. See `packages/support/AGENTS.md` |
| `API_PORT`, `API_PUBLIC_URL` | `apps/api` (port; OpenAPI `servers` and email tracking URLs, falls back to the request origin outside production); `API_PUBLIC_URL` also `apps/worker` (email tracking) and `apps/web` (quick-start snippets, read at runtime) |
| `API_CORS_ORIGINS` | `apps/api`: comma-separated browser origins allowed on `/v1/*` (the docs' playground); default `https://coss.com`, locally `http://localhost:3002` |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | api, web, worker: provider for live environments (`fake` or `ses`); shape in `@coss/email/env` |
| `AWS_REGION`, `SES_CONFIGURATION_SET`, `SES_TENANT_PREFIX` | required with `EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses` (api, web, worker); printed by `ses:bootstrap`. The marketing stream's configuration set is derived (`<SES_CONFIGURATION_SET>-marketing`); the prefix is at most 23 characters. AWS credentials come from the default chain (`globalPassThroughEnv` in `turbo.json`) |
| `TRACKING_DOMAIN_PROVIDER`, `TRACKING_DISTRIBUTION_ID`, `TRACKING_CONNECTION_GROUP_ID`, `TRACKING_CNAME_TARGET` | api, web, worker, smtp: custom tracking domains (`fake` default, or `cloudfront`: tenants of a CloudFront multi-tenant distribution, which needs all three others); customers CNAME to `TRACKING_CNAME_TARGET`, the connection group's routing endpoint; shape in `@coss/email/env` |
| `TRACKING_PUBLIC_URL` | api + worker + smtp: origin of the open/click tracking links in emails (default `API_PUBLIC_URL`; smtp: required in production, locally `http://localhost:3001`); production `https://track.cosslinks.com`, a domain of its own so senders' abuse never lands on coss.com |
| `SES_EVENTS_QUEUE_URL` | worker with `EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses`: the SQS queue of SES events |
| `INBOUND_MANAGED_DOMAIN`, `SES_INBOUND_BUCKET` | api, web, worker: receiving. The managed inbound domain (`<label>.<domain>` addresses per environment; default `inbound.coss.test` with the fake provider) and, with SES, the bucket received content lives in (both or neither with SES; unset → receiving off). Printed by `ses:bootstrap --managed-domain` |
| `SES_INBOUND_QUEUE_URL` | worker with SES receiving: the SQS queue of receipt notifications |
| `APNS_KEY_ID`, `APNS_TEAM_ID`, `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`, `APNS_TOPIC`, `APNS_ENVIRONMENTS` | worker: push notifications to the iOS app through APNs with a token-based `.p8` key (its id, the Apple Developer team, the PEM contents — `\n` line breaks accepted — the bundle id, default `com.coss.ios`, and the gateways the key serves, default `production,sandbox`; devices registered for another are skipped). The first three together or none; unset → printed in development, held in production |
| `NOTIFICATIONS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, `NOTIFICATIONS_FROM` | web reads the id only to refuse admin suspensions of coss.com's own organization (`isSystemOrganization`, `apps/web/src/lib/system-organization.ts`); api: Verify's email codes for environments without a sender of their own ("<app> via coss.com"), and the organization plans and caps never limit; worker: account emails (verification, password reset, invitation) and reputation notification emails go out through coss.com's own email product from this live environment (of coss.com's own org) and sender (on one of its verified domains). Both or neither; unset → held in production (account email links are printed by the dashboard outside production) |
| `VERIFY_SMS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`, `VERIFY_SMS_FROM` | api: Verify's shared numbers — a live environment of coss.com's own organization (`NOTIFICATIONS_ENVIRONMENT_ID`'s) and its approved numbers registered for one-time codes (comma-separated E.164). Both or neither; unset → live SMS codes need the environment's own number (`shared_sender_unavailable`). Shape in `@coss/verify/env` |
| `SMTP_HOSTNAME`, `SMTP_IMPLICIT_TLS_PORT`, `SMTP_STARTTLS_PORT` | smtp: the relay's name (greeting, certificate; production `smtp.coss.com`) and the ports it listens on (default 2465/2587; the NLB maps 465/587 onto them) |
| `SMTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE_ARN`, `SMTP_TLS_PASSPHRASE` | smtp (production, both required): the exportable ACM certificate the relay exports at start and every 12 hours, and the passphrase that encrypts the exported key in transit. The ARN is set by Terraform (`generated_env`) |
| `SMTP_TLS_CERT_FILE`, `SMTP_TLS_KEY_FILE` | smtp (development): a certificate from files; neither → a self-signed one made with `openssl` (clients skip verification) |
| `SMTP_PUBLIC_HOST` | web: the relay's host shown with its settings on environment pages (default `localhost` outside production; unset in production hides them) |
| `VALKEY_URL`, `VALKEY_CLUSTER` | api + web + worker (the daily inbound limit, Hooks delivery limits) + smtp: rate limit counters (`rediss://user:pass@…`, `true` for ElastiCache Serverless; printed by `valkey:bootstrap`). Required in production; unset → in-memory per process |
| `RATE_LIMIT_KEY_PREFIX` | api + web: namespaces Valkey keys (default `coss`) |
| `CLIENT_IP_HEADER`, `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` | api + web: where the client IP comes from (e.g. `x-forwarded-for`, proxies of ours appending to it). Unset → public unauthenticated limits use an aggregate fallback subject instead of a per-IP subject |
| `TEST_VALKEY_URL` | ratelimit + api tests (keys under a random prefix, never flushed) |
| `RISK_HASH_KEY` | api + web: 32-byte base64 key of every HMAC risk remembers identifiers by (velocity keys, mailbox identities, fraud reports); required in production, a fixed development key otherwise. Changing it resets that memory |
| `IPINFO_TOKEN` | worker: downloads IPinfo Lite (ASN + country, CC BY-SA 4.0) for risk's IP signals; unset → Tor and cloud ranges only |
| `EMAIL_LINK_KEYS` | api + worker: comma-separated 32-byte base64 keys, newest first (the first encrypts); marketing email's preference center, unsubscribe and double opt-in links (`@coss/email` `link-tokens.ts`). Required in production (`linkKeysFromEnv`), a fixed development key otherwise. Retired keys stay listed for years: dropping one breaks every link made with it (README, "Rotating `EMAIL_LINK_KEYS`") |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRETS_KEY` | api + web + worker: comma-separated 32-byte base64 keys, newest first (the first encrypts, all decrypt); encrypts endpoint signing secrets (and the provider keys imports hold) (losing it makes them unreadable). Shape in `@coss/webhooks/env` |
| `WORKER_LOOPS` | worker: comma-separated loops to run (`WORKER_LOOP_NAMES` in `apps/worker/src/jobs.ts`, including the `email-dispatch` and `email-dispatch-marketing` queues); unset runs all. A second worker service with `hooks` scales Hooks deliveries on their own |
| `LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | worker: days of environment logs kept (1-31, default 30); whole expired day partitions are dropped hourly |
| `SCHEDULING_DATA_KEYS` | api, web, worker: comma-separated 32-byte base64 keys, newest first, encrypting attendees' details and answers. Unset in production → Scheduling is off (503 `scheduling_unavailable`); a fixed development key otherwise |
| `SCHEDULING_PUBLIC_URL` | api, web, worker: origin of the hosted scheduling pages (`apps/scheduling`). Default `http://localhost:3005` outside production; unset in production → sessions have no `url` and emails no manage link |
| `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MICROSOFT_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID`, `MICROSOFT_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET` | api, worker: Scheduling's OAuth apps for calendar access, separate from sign-in's. Redirect URIs `${API_PUBLIC_URL}/scheduling/oauth/{google,microsoft}/callback`. Each pair together, or that provider can't be connected |
| `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ZOOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN` | api, worker: Scheduling's Zoom app, for meetings on hosts' accounts. Redirect URI `${API_PUBLIC_URL}/scheduling/oauth/zoom/callback`, deauthorization events at `${API_PUBLIC_URL}/scheduling/zoom/events`, verified with the token. The pair together, or Zoom can't be connected |
| `SMS_PROVIDER` | api, web, worker: provider of live environments' SMS and of new numbers (`fake` default, or `twilio`). Production with `fake` refuses to buy numbers or submit registrations, so nothing live is sent; the api only needs the name (callbacks are verified with each subaccount's token). Shape in `@coss/sms/env` |
| `RISK_PHONE_LOOKUP`, `RISK_PHONE_SIM_SWAP` | api: risk's phone checks in live environments (`off` default: live checks answer 503; `twilio`: Twilio Lookup's line type and carrier with the parent account's `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`/`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, paid per lookup — Twilio's DPA purpose must cover it first). `RISK_PHONE_SIM_SWAP=true` also asks for SIM swaps (only after Twilio's carrier approval and adding them back to the DPA: the phone check data and Annex 3's Twilio row). Sandbox environments use fixtures |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PRIMARY_CUSTOMER_PROFILE_SID`, `SMS_SUBACCOUNT_PREFIX` | web + worker with `SMS_PROVIDER=twilio` (the first two also api, with `RISK_PHONE_LOOKUP=twilio`): Cal.com's parent Twilio account (shared ISV), the approved primary customer profile organizations' 10DLC brands are registered under, and the prefix of the subaccounts coss.com creates (`<prefix>-<organization id>`). Twilio calls back `${API_PUBLIC_URL}/sms/twilio/*` |
| `SMS_NEGOTIATED_COSTS` | `bun run sms:update-prices` only (never deployed or committed): Twilio's negotiated per-segment costs by country, JSON in dollars |
| `BILLING_PROVIDER`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | web + worker: the payment provider of new billing accounts (`fake` default, or `stripe`, which needs the key); the webhook secret only the dashboard (`/api/billing/webhook`). Shape in `@coss/billing/env` |
| `SCREENING_CLASSIFIER`, `SCREENING_MODEL`, `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | worker: content screening (`off`/`fake`/`ai`; a Vercel AI Gateway decision model id, default `typesafe-ai/jev`; the Gateway key, required with `ai`). The model and key also serve the api's `RISK_CLASSIFIER` |
| `RISK_IP_PRIVACY`, `IPINFO_PRIVACY_TOKEN` | api (+ web, for its sign-up assessments): risk's VPN/proxy/relay data per address (`off` default; `ipinfo`: IPinfo's privacy detection with a paid plan's token, which sends every assessed public IP to IPinfo — list it as a subprocessor first). Without it, VPNs are only guessed from the network (`ip.vpn_network`) |
| `RISK_SIGNUP_ENVIRONMENT_ID` | web: a live environment of coss.com's own organization that assesses the dashboard's sign-ups (dogfooding; `block` refuses them, `review` waits in its queue). Unset: not assessed |
| `RISK_CLASSIFIER` | api: risk's content classification in live environments (`off` default: classify answers 503 and assessments skip content; `fake`: the `[coss-test:…]` markers; `ai`: `SCREENING_MODEL` with `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`). Sandbox environments always use the markers |
| `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | api, worker, web: Sentry (each its own project's DSN; web's also serves browsers of both zones); unset → nothing reported. Read before t3-env (`src/instrument.ts`, `src/lib/monitoring-server.ts`, `/api/monitoring`) and validated by it (`sentryEnvShape`) |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE` | api, worker: the image's commit (Dockerfile build argument); the Next apps' release is `NEXT_DEPLOYMENT_ID`, injected at build |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (`SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`) | Next builds only (`globalPassThroughEnv`; a BuildKit secret in the Dockerfiles): uploads source maps to `cosscom`/`web` and deletes them from the build. Unset → no source maps |
| `NODE_ENV`, `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION` | `production` makes dev auth emails and the seed refuse to run; the latter skips t3-env (image builds set it) |
| `SKIP_BUILD_TYPECHECK` | `1` makes `next build` (web, site) skip its TypeScript check; set only by CI's build job (its check job typechecks) |
| `TURBO_TOKEN`, `TURBO_TEAM`, `TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY` | turbo itself (Vercel Remote Cache, team `cal`): locally `turbo login` stores the token and `~/.config/coss/turbo.env` (sourced by the shell profile) sets the other two; in CI `secrets.TURBO_TOKEN`, `vars.TURBO_TEAM`, `secrets.TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY`. Never in `.env` (turbo doesn't read it) |
| `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `apps/web`: Server Actions key shared by every dashboard task of a stage (base64, 16/24/32 bytes); read at runtime, required in production |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | `apps/web` (read by `packages/auth/src/social.ts`): sign-in with Google / GitHub, each on when both of its values are set (`src/instrumentation.ts` refuses half a pair). Callbacks `${BETTER_AUTH_URL}/api/auth/callback/{google,github}`. Production: ids plain (tfvars), secrets in the stage secret — put the secrets there **before** the `terraform apply` that adds them, or web tasks can't start |
| `DOMAIN_CONNECT_KEY_ID`, `DOMAIN_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY` | `apps/web`: Domain Connect, one-click DNS setup on domain pages (`src/lib/domain-connect.ts`, `@coss/email/domain-connect`): the RSA key apply links are signed with and the TXT host its public half is published at under coss.com (`bun run domain-connect:key`; README, "Domain Connect"). Both or neither (`src/instrumentation.ts`); unset → no button. The key may be one line with `\n` escapes |
| `DEPLOY_GITHUB_APP_ID`, `DEPLOY_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | `apps/web`: the admin console's Deploys page (`src/lib/deploys.ts`), through the coss.com Deploy GitHub App (Actions read/write, Contents read on `cosscom/coss`; README, "Deploying from the admin console"). Both or neither (`src/instrumentation.ts`); unset → the page explains the setup. The key may be one line with `\n` escapes. The app's bot is on `deploy_actor_ids` |
| `SECURITY_MANAGEMENT_ROLE_ARN`, `SECURITY_ALERTS_TOPIC_ARN`, `SECURITY_ACCESS_LOGS_BUCKET`, `SECURITY_DATABASE_LOG_GROUP` | `apps/web`: the admin console's security page (`src/lib/security-posture.ts`; `infra/AGENTS.md`, "Security monitoring"): the management account's read-only role, the alert topic, the access logs bucket and the database's log group. Unset: the page explains the setup |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | `apps/web`: Cloudflare Turnstile (both or neither; required in production, checked in `src/instrumentation.ts`). Pages pass the site key to the auth forms; `packages/auth/src/options.ts` adds the `captcha` plugin when the secret is set |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` | `apps/web`: proxies that append to `X-Forwarded-For` (CloudFront → ALB: `2`; default `0`). `src/proxy.ts` replaces the header with the one client address they vouch for, which Better Auth then uses (it ignores multi-value headers) |
| `NEXT_DEPLOYMENT_ID` | Next builds (`apps/web`, `apps/site`): the commit, passed by the Dockerfiles; build id + version-skew protection |
| `PORT`, `HOSTNAME`, `KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT` | set by the Next images (standalone `server.js`) |
| `SEED_PASSWORD` | `db:seed` demo password (only when the user is first created) |
| `COSS_API_KEY`, `COSS_BASE_URL` | SDK defaults / `packages/sdk/examples` only (the example also reads `COSS_FROM`, `COSS_TO`); also the MCP server's and the CLI's (where they win over a saved profile) |
| `COSS_DASHBOARD_URL`, `COSS_PROFILE`, `COSS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | the CLI only (`packages/cli`): the dashboard `coss login` opens (default `https://coss.com`), which saved profile commands use, and `1` to turn off the daily update notice |

Adding one: `.env.example`, the app's t3-env schema, **`turbo.json` `globalPassThroughEnv`** (strict env mode drops
undeclared vars from tasks — CI and image builds have no `.env`), the service in `infra/aws/services.ts` (a test fails
otherwise), and `ci.yml` if CI needs it. Only a variable that changes what a task *produces* goes in `globalEnv`
instead (today `NODE_ENV`, `NEXT_DEPLOYMENT_ID`; `infra/test` pins the list): those values are part of every task hash,
and laptops and CI must compute the same hashes to share the remote cache (README, "Remote cache"). Runtime values
are never inlined into builds (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`), which is what makes pass-through safe.

## Rules next to the code

Read the file before changing that code. Each loads when you open files in its directory, so read it yourself when you
work on it from elsewhere.

- `apps/api/AGENTS.md`: the public API (app wiring, the error envelope, adding endpoints, versions, long polls, trace
  context, CORS).
- `apps/web/AGENTS.md`: the dashboard (pages, server actions, toasts, coss ui, URLs and routes).
- `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md`: the SDK (client, runtimes, React Email, integrations, tracing, wire types, releases, npm
  publishing).
- `packages/mcp/AGENTS.md`: the MCP server. `packages/cli/AGENTS.md`: the CLI and its standalone executables.
- `integrations/AGENTS.md`: the Laravel, Rails and Django drivers and their publishing.

## Coding agents

What an agent pointed at coss.com reads, all describing the same facts — change them together:
- `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` open with `AGENT_BRIEF` (`apps/site/src/lib/llms.ts`): how to read the docs, get a
  key with `npx coss-cli init`, the SDK's conventions, testing webhooks. Every docs page is Markdown at `<page>.md`
  (`apps/site/AGENTS.md`); API reference pages render the OpenAPI document (`operation-markdown.ts`). `/llms.txt` lists
  the guides within a size budget; API operations are in `/docs/<product>/llms.txt` and `/docs/api-reference/llms.txt`.
- The landing page's prompt (`AGENT_PROMPT`, `apps/site/src/lib/site.ts`), quoted by `/docs/agents`.
- The `coss` skill (`plugins/coss/skills/coss/SKILL.md`), the notes `coss init` writes into a project's
  AGENTS.md (`agentNotes`, `packages/cli/src/commands/init.ts`) and the MCP server's instructions (`packages/mcp/src/server.ts`).
- `apps/api/test/agent-surface.test.ts` keeps them complete: every API operation is called by an MCP tool or CLI command,
  or listed with a reason in `agent-surface-exemptions.ts`. Setup reports describe a project's setup state, never whether a
  product is on in a deployment.
- `claude plugin validate .` and `claude plugin validate plugins/coss` check the marketplace and the plugin. The
  plugin has no `version` on purpose: installs follow main. Its MCP server takes the key from the plugin's optional
  `api_key` (`userConfig`); without one `coss-mcp` serves only the docs tools. Its optional `toolsets` becomes
  `COSS_MCP_TOOLSETS`, where empty means every tool.

## coss.com zones

- coss.com is shared by Next.js multi-zones, routed by the ALB (not Next rewrites): the dashboard is the default zone
  (org slugs, `/dashboard`, `/api/*`, bare `/_next/*`); the site, the coss ui repository's apps (`/ui`, `/origin`) and
  qnot's site (`/qnot`, the `cosscom/qnot` repository's `apps/web`, Vercel project `coss-com-qnot` with
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/qnot`) — the last three deployed on Vercel and served by CloudFront from their own origins — get the paths in **`ZONE_ROUTES`**
  (`@coss/auth/slugs`, client-safe), from which `RESERVED_ORG_SLUGS`, the ALB rules and CloudFront behaviours
  (`infra/aws/routing.ts`) are derived. Adding a site page = a `ZONE_ROUTES` entry (unless `/docs` etc. covers it) +
  the route; `apps/site/test/reserved-slugs.test.ts` fails otherwise. The site's assets live under its
  `assetPrefix` (`SITE_ASSET_PREFIX`, `/site-assets`); its search is `/docs/search.json`.
- Org slugs can't be taken back once used, so plausible future site pages (pricing, blog, products, legal, …) are
  reserved up front in `slugs.ts`. Slugs are ≥ 3 characters, so a localized site must use 2-letter prefixes
  (`/de/…`), never `xx-yy` codes (valid slugs). Reserve a new marketing path before any org can take it.
- Same origin: any script on the site can act as the signed-in dashboard user. Both apps send a CSP without
  third-party script origins (except the dashboard's `TURNSTILE_ORIGIN`, script + frame only) and deny framing (`src/lib/security-headers.ts` in each); see `apps/site/AGENTS.md`.
- Local dev keeps separate ports: `localhost:3000` redirects `/` to `/dashboard` and `/legal/*` to the site, and
  proxies `/icon.svg` to the site;
  the site proxies `/api/auth/*` to :3000 and links with `dashboardUrl()`.

## Containers and deployment (AWS)

- `apps/{web,site,portal,api,worker}/Dockerfile`, built from the repository root (`docker build -f apps/web/Dockerfile .`):
  `turbo prune --docker` (works with `bun.lock` and the isolated linker) → `bun install --frozen-lockfile` → build →
  a small non-root runtime image. Bun/Node/turbo versions are `ARG`s that `infra/test` keeps equal to `package.json`.
- Next apps use `output: "standalone"` with `outputFileTracingRoot` at the monorepo root; the traced
  `node_modules/.bun` keeps relative symlinks, which resolve after copying (verified). They run `node
  apps/<app>/server.js` on Node 24. `generateBuildId` uses `NEXT_DEPLOYMENT_ID` (Next sets it to `""` when unset,
  hence `||`). api and worker run their TypeScript source on Bun from a `--production` prune. The api's image also
  builds `coss-mcp` and `coss` in a stage of its own (they run from `dist`, as published; `POST /mcp`) and copies only
  their `dist`.
- Build once, deploy to any stage: nothing stage-specific at build time (`SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION`), validation at
  startup. `next.config.ts` runs only at build/dev time and is serialized into the standalone server: decide nothing
  there from runtime env.
- Health checks: `/api/health` (web, site, portal; public in `proxy.ts`), `/health` (api); none touch the database.
- SIGTERM: Next drains itself; the API (`src/server.ts`) stops accepting, finishes in-flight requests, closes the pg
  pool; the worker (`src/shutdown.ts`) aborts the SQS poll and long runs between items, waits for each loop's current
  run, closes the pool. Idle keep-alive timeouts (75 s) exceed the ALB's 60 s.
- Migrations: `bun packages/db/src/migrate.ts` (drizzle-orm's migrator, no drizzle-kit) as a one-off task from the
  worker image. Runbook, resources, IAM and deploy order: README.md, "Deploying to AWS"; machine-readable: `infra/`.

## Tests

- `bun:test` (the dashboard's browser smoke tests are Playwright, `apps/web/AGENTS.md`). DB-backed suites (`apps/api`, `apps/smtp`, `apps/worker`, `packages/billing`, `packages/email`, `packages/forms`, `packages/hooks`, `packages/migrate`, `packages/notifications`, `packages/push`, `packages/reputation`, `packages/risk`, `packages/scheduling`, `packages/screening`, `packages/tenancy`, `packages/verify`, `packages/webhooks`) preload `test/setup.ts` via their
  `bunfig.toml` → `@coss/db/testing`, which throws unless `TEST_DATABASE_URL` names a `*_test` database, then points
  `DATABASE_URL` at it. Other suites are DB-free; before adding DB tests elsewhere copy `packages/email/bunfig.toml` +
  `test/setup.ts`, or the tests hit the dev database.
- Tests never truncate; every test creates its own uniquely named fixtures: `createTestTenant()` (owner, org, project,
  `production`/`development`, `liveKey`/`sandboxKey`), `createTestUser()`, `addMember()` from `@coss/tenancy/testing`;
  `uniqueSuffix()` from `@coss/db/testing`. API: `createTestApp()` (sends only enqueue; its `dispatch()` runs the queued
  jobs) + `errorOf(res)` (`apps/api/test/helpers.ts`). Email: `memoryDispatchQueue()` (records jobs; `drain(service)`
  dispatches them), `dispatchingEmailService()` (send + dispatch in one call, for tests about what happens after dispatch),
  `FakeEmailProvider({ log: false, fail })`, `gatedProvider()` for races, `createVerifiedDomain(orgId)` (live sends need
  one), `FakeSesApi`, `fakeDnsResolver()`, `FakeCloudFrontTenantsApi` (a `CloudFrontTenantsApi` for `CloudFrontTrackingHostnameProvider`)
  from `@coss/email/testing`, `FakeTrackingHostnameProvider({ state })` from `@coss/email`. Receiving:
  `receiveFakeEmail()` + `buildTestMessage()` + `FakeInboundStore` from `@coss/email`, `FakeS3Api` and
  `sesReceiptNotification()` from `@coss/email/testing`; `createTestApp()` returns its `inbound` runtime. Real pg-boss tests use their own queue name
  (`packages/email/test/dispatch.test.ts`). Rate limits: `memoryLimiter({ overrides })`,
  `testValkeyLimiter()` from `@coss/ratelimit/testing`; `createTestApp({ rateLimiter, clientIp })` (defaults to an
  in-memory limiter per app); tighten limits for a test org with `setRateLimitOverride`. Webhooks: `webhookReceiver()` (local server),
  `testSender()`, `testManagementDeps` from `@coss/webhooks/testing`. Hooks: `testHookDeps`, `testHookDeliveryDeps({ send, throttle, … })` (no jitter)
  from `@coss/hooks/testing`; the test preload creates this week's Hooks partitions (they have no default partition). Screening: `fakeClassifier({ scores, fail, delayMs })` from
  `@coss/screening/testing` (markers like `[coss-test:phishing]` in the content score 0.99). Billing (`@coss/billing/testing`):
`createTestContract(orgId, terms, { effectiveFrom })`, `recordTestUsage({ …, at })`, `testBillingProviders()` (a
`FakeBillingProvider` with `willCollect(...)`/`fail(op)`), `FakeStripeApi` (`fetch` for `StripeBillingProvider`);
month closes, dunning and usage checks take `now` and `scope`; `createTestApp({ plans, billing })`, `screenMessage(…, { random })`
  for deterministic sampling, `Experimental_DecisionMockModelV4` (`ai/test`) for the AI SDK adapter; `dispatchingEmailService({ screen })`. Risk: `testRiskDeps(overrides)` (fixed IP data for `TEST_IPS`, fake DNS via `fakeMailDomains`, in-memory velocity) from `@coss/risk/testing`, `buildTestMmdb` from `@coss/signals/testing`; `createTestApp({ riskDeps })`. Worker-style scans take `scope: { organizationIds }`
  and `now` — always pass `scope` in tests (the test DB is shared and never truncated). Session-bound Better Auth calls: sign in with
  `auth.api.signInEmail({ returnHeaders: true })` and forward the cookie (`packages/tenancy/test/hardening.test.ts`).

## Recipes

**Add a table:** add a prefix to `ID_PREFIXES`; define the table in `packages/db/src/schema/domain.ts` with a `text` id
(`$defaultFn(() => newId(ID_PREFIXES.x))`), `organization_id NOT NULL`, a composite FK `(parent_id, organization_id) →
parent(id, organization_id)` and the `createdAt()`/`updatedAt()` helpers (history tables must not FK `apikey` — Better
Auth hard-deletes keys); `bun run db:generate`, review and commit the SQL + `migrations/meta/`, `bun run db:migrate`.
Never edit an applied migration; do renames as a separate step (drizzle-kit prompts interactively).

**Add a product** (e.g. `video`; `packages/scheduling` is the most recent one built this way):
1. Tables + ID prefix (above).
2. `packages/<product>`: `src/schemas.ts` (zod `strictObject`, snake_case, `.meta({ id })`, no DB imports, exported as
   `./schemas`), provider interface + fake provider, a service taking the authenticated environment, an error class with
   statuses, `bunfig.toml` + `test/setup.ts` preload.
3. Permissions: add the resource to `orgStatements` and the roles (`packages/auth/src/permissions.ts`), to
   `API_KEY_PERMISSIONS` (`packages/auth/src/constants.ts`) and its label, group and description to `API_KEY_RESOURCES`
   (`packages/auth/src/api-key-permissions.ts`; a test fails otherwise, and the dashboard and docs read them).
   Full-access keys (`environment_api_key.access = 'full'`) get the new permissions at once (resolved from the catalog on
   every request); restricted keys keep exactly what they were created with — never backfill `apikey.permissions` (the
   pre-`0080` migrations `0004`…`0077` did, when every key was full).
4. API: `src/routes/<resource>.ts` mounted in `routes/v1.ts`, service injected via `createApp` options, error class
   mapped in `toApiError`, OpenAPI path list in `test/app.test.ts` updated.
5. SDK: types, resource, `Coss` property, `src/index.ts` exports, unit tests; extend `contract-types.ts` +
   `sdk-contract.test.ts`.
6. Docs (`apps/site`): `bun run openapi:generate`, SDK samples (and `SDK_METHODS` entries) for the new operations, a guide under
   `content/docs/<product>/` (a section of its own: `"root": true`, an `icon` and a `description` in its `meta.json`,
   listed in `content/docs/meta.json`) with Twoslash SDK examples (per-method SDK usage lives in the API reference),
   and its API tags under a `---<Product>---` separator in `content/docs/api-reference/meta.json` (a test fails otherwise).
7. Dashboard: dependency + `transpilePackages`; a `PRODUCTS` entry in `@coss/dashboard-routes` (its pages, category,
   docs), an icon in `PRODUCT_ICONS` and a probe in `productActivityByEnvironment`/`productFigures`
   (`@coss/tenancy`); pages under `[orgSlug]/[projectSlug]/[envSlug]/<product>/`.
8. Events/webhooks: record events in the product's own table and call `enqueueWebhookMessage(tx, …)` from
   `@coss/webhooks` in the same transaction; add the payload zod schema + SDK type + contract assertion.
9. Logs: append a log line per new event with `appendLogEntries(tx, …)` from `@coss/logs` in the same transaction
   (only for rows actually inserted, so deduplicated events aren't logged twice), and add a `LogSource` value
   (enum migration + `LOG_SOURCES` + SDK `LogSource`). Mutations of the product's settings record
   `recordAudit` (dashboard) / `recordApiAudit` (API) audit events.
10. Billing: its meter is in `METERS` and priced in `RATE_CARDS` (`@coss/billing/catalog`; video and scheduling
   already are). Call `recordUsage(tx, …)` from `@coss/billing/metering` once per billable event, in the transaction
   that makes it billable (guard it with a compare-and-set, like `email.usage_recorded_at`), and reserve capped usage
   at acceptance through an injected `UsageGate` (as `EmailServiceOptions.billing` does). Plan-gated creation takes an
   injected `PlanGate`.

**Partitioned tables** (only `log_entry` so far): drizzle-kit can't declare partitioning, so declare the table in the
schema as usual (composite primary key including the partition column), `db:generate` it, then add a `--custom`
migration that drops the still-empty table and recreates it identically with `PARTITION BY` (see `0027`/`0028`).
Later column changes generated by drizzle-kit apply to partitioned tables as they are. The worker keeps daily
partitions ahead and drops expired ones through `@coss/db/partitions` (`ensurePartitions`/`dropExpiredPartitions`,
by `{ table, column, defaultPartition }`): a table with a default partition is dropped under a short ACCESS EXCLUSIVE
lock; one without is detached `CONCURRENTLY` (Postgres refuses that with a default partition), but rejects inserts
outside its created days. Nothing may hold an FK into a partitioned table.

**Make a breaking API change** (renaming/removing a field, changing a type or default — additive changes need none of
this): append today's date to `API_VERSIONS` (`packages/versioning/src/versions.ts`) and add a `VersionChange` to
`VERSION_CHANGES` (`changes.ts`) whose `responses` transforms (keyed by the wire `object`) rebuild the previous shape
from the new one — an event-data change needs both `email_event` (API) and `event` (webhooks, `eventDataTransform`) —
and whose `requests` transforms upgrade old request bodies. Change the handlers/schemas to the new shape, test the
old shape through the real registry, mirror the date in the SDK (`API_VERSIONS`, `API_VERSION`, wire types) with a
changeset, `bun run openapi:generate`. Organizations stay on their pin until they upgrade in the dashboard; endpoints
keep theirs. `title`/`description` appear in the docs changelog and the upgrade dialog. Don't add a version for a
change that can't be expressed as a transform — that is a `/v2`.

**Add a reputation trigger**: a *measured* signal is a `ReputationCheck`
(`{ trigger, evaluate(context) }`, see `packages/email/src/reputation-checks.ts`; `rateResult` grades rates) passed to
`runDueReputationEvaluations` in `apps/worker/src/jobs.ts` — all checks of one evaluation share one `context` object,
and mark the org due (`markReputationDue`) when new evidence arrives. A *one-off verdict* calls
`suspendOrganization({ organizationId, trigger: "<name>", actor: { kind: "system" }, note }, tx?)` directly (content
screening does both: it suspends on a block and its check keeps the verdicts in the window). Either way add
the trigger's label to `TRIGGER_LABELS` (`packages/reputation/src/schemas.ts`, shared by the dashboard and the
notification emails) and, if there is useful advice, to `ADVICE` (`packages/reputation/src/notifications.ts`); new thresholds go in
`ReputationPolicy` (+ overrides schema and the admin `PolicyForm`).

## Generated / managed files — don't hand-edit

- `packages/db/src/schema/auth.ts` (`bun run auth:generate`) and `packages/db/migrations/**` (`bun run db:generate`).
- `apps/api/openapi.json` (`bun run openapi:generate`; excluded from Biome) and `packages/sdk/src/core/routes.generated.ts`
  (the same command).
- `infra/terraform/spec.json` (`bun run --cwd infra aws:spec:write`; excluded from Biome).
- `packages/sdk/package.json` `exports`/`main`/`module`/`types` (rewritten by the SDK build — commit the result).
- `sdks/<language>/**` (`bun run sdks:generate`; excluded from Biome) except the files its `.fernignore` lists,
  `sdks/VERSION` and the CHANGELOGs (the "Regenerate SDKs" PR bumps both), and `tooling/sdkgen/snippets.json`.
- `packages/kloq/src`: kloq's library, vendored from `cosscom/calendar` (excluded from Biome); and
  `apps/site/src/lib/calendar/registry/generated.json` + `apps/site/src/components/calendar/registry/what-lands.json`
  (`bun run --cwd apps/site calendar:registry` after changing the library or the registry's blocks; a test fails when stale).
- `packages/ui/src/{components,hooks,lib}`: vendored from the `@coss` registry and excluded from Biome; re-adding a
  component overwrites local edits.
- `bun.lock` (only via `bun install`; CI uses `--frozen-lockfile`).
- `packages/signals/src/disposable-domains.generated.ts` (`bun run signals:update-disposable`; local exceptions go in
  `ALLOWED_DOMAINS` / `EXTRA_DISPOSABLE_DOMAINS` in `packages/signals/src/email.ts`).
- The `<!-- BEGIN:*-agent-rules -->` blocks at the end of this file and in `apps/{web,site}/AGENTS.md` are rewritten by `turbo`
  and `next dev`: never edit inside them, keep project text above them, and commit tool changes to them.
- Agent docs: `AGENTS.md` files are the source of truth; each `CLAUDE.md` contains only `@AGENTS.md`. A new nested
  `AGENTS.md` needs a sibling `CLAUDE.md` shim, or Claude Code never sees it. Claude Code warns when the files it loads at
  start pass 150k characters, so detail about one app or package goes in that directory's file, not the root.

## Guardrails (verified against the versions in the root catalog — re-verify a bullet when bumping that library)

- **Runtimes:** Next.js and the `auth` / `drizzle-kit` CLIs run on **Node**; the API, scripts and tests run on Bun.
  Shared package `src/` must not use `Bun.*` or `bun:*` (tests may use `bun:test`) — use `pg` /
  `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` and `node:crypto`. Never `next --bun`, never `[run] bun = true` in bunfig.
- **TypeScript 7** (native, no JS API): `types` defaults to `[]` (list `["bun"]`/`["node"]`); `baseUrl` and
  `moduleResolution: node` are errors. VS Code needs the "TypeScript (Native Preview)" extension.
- **Next 16:** middleware is `src/proxy.ts`; request APIs and `params` are async; no `next lint`; keep `cacheComponents`
  off. Next doesn't edit tsconfigs that use `extends` — keep the manual `next` plugin + `.next/types` includes.
- **Drizzle 0.x** (see catalog): the drizzle.team docs default to v1 — don't use `defineRelations`, `drizzle-orm/zod`,
  `getColumns` until the catalog moves to 1.x.
- **Biome** is pinned exactly; keep the `$schema` URL in `biome.json` and `apps/web/biome.json` in step with it.
- **Better Auth** (details in `packages/auth/AGENTS.md` — read it before changing sign-in, sessions, API keys,
  invitations, org membership, 2FA, passkeys, social sign-in, SSO, SCIM, the iOS app's sign-in or account emails,
  including dashboard actions that call `auth.api.*`): `better-auth`, `@better-auth/core`, `@better-auth/api-key`,
  `@better-auth/passkey`, `@better-auth/sso`, `@better-auth/scim` and `auth` (CLI) stay on one identical exact version
  (catalog). Keys are organization keys or members' personal keys (their usage is that member's spend; see
  `packages/auth/AGENTS.md`). Keys are created only by `createEnvironmentApiKey` and authenticated only by `authenticateApiKey` (never
  `verifyApiKey`). `disabledPaths` blocks the HTTP routes of API keys, every organization route but
  create/accept-invitation, account changes, admin mutations and SSO provider management (server-side `auth.api.*`
  still works) — never re-enable them to "simplify" things. Better Auth's `bearer` plugin stays off (the iOS app's
  credential works only on `/api/mobile/*`). Never add NOT NULL columns to Better Auth tables. `packages/auth` must not
  import `next/*` or `"server-only"`; `nextCookies()` is appended last, only in `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`.
- **Tenancy rule:** every tenancy/email/webhooks function that touches tenant data takes `organizationId` and scopes its
  SQL by it; writes derive org/project from the environment row. Only `getMembership` (by slug), `authenticateApiKey`
  (from the key's binding), the platform-level `@coss/tenancy/admin`, `@coss/email/admin` and `@coss/support/admin` modules,
  `listScreeningsForAdmin`/`countScreeningsForAdmin` (`@coss/screening`) and `platformUsageByDay` (`@coss/billing`)
  (call them only after `requirePlatformAdmin*`), and these system-level functions resolve the org
  themselves (scoping every write by the row's own org): `recordProviderEvent`/`ingestProviderEvents` (from the email
  id tag), `applyTenantStatus` (prefix-checked tenant name), `authorizeLiveSender` (reads domain names across orgs),
  `recordOpen`/`recordClick` (from the email's tracking token), `trackingBaseUrlFor` (dispatch; reads domain names
  across orgs like `authorizeLiveSender`), `receiveEmail`/`routeRecipients` (receiving; from the envelope recipients), `recordSmsEvent`/`ingestSmsEvents` (from the `sms_id` of the callback URL), `receiveSms` (from the receiving number), `handleStatusCallback`/`handleInboundCallback` (from the callback's subaccount), `authorizeLiveSmsSender`, `ingestDmarcReports` (from the report address's token), `reencryptWebhookSecrets`, `reencryptSchedulingData` (operator scripts), `authenticateHookPortalSession` (from the session), `ingestSupportEmails` (one environment, across senders) and the rest of `@coss/support`'s worker functions, `submitForm`/`getHostedForm` (from the form id of `/f/:id`), `confirmFormSubmission`/`findConfirmation` (from the verification token), and the worker scans `runDueWebhookDeliveries`, `runDueLogDrainDeliveries`, `runDueHookDeliveries`, `parkHeldHookDeliveries`, `runDueHookRecoveries`, the Hooks purges, `recheckDueDomains`,
  `recheckDueTrackingDomains`, `recheckDueReceivingDomains`, `reconcileDedicatedIpPools`, `sweepStaleClaims`, `sweepUnclaimedEmails`, `runDueReputationEvaluations`, `runDueSubaccountEvaluations`, `runDueOrganizationDeletions`, `runDueOrganizationLogos`, `runDueSubaccountDeletions`, `runDueDmarcNotifications`, `runDueMigrations`, `EmailService.dispatchDue`,
  `unclaimedEmailBacklog`, `unclaimedSmsBacklog` (the `dispatch-backlog` loop: counts only), `SmsService.dispatchDue`, `sweepStaleSmsClaims`, `sweepUnclaimedSms`, `advanceDueSmsRegistrations`, `chargeDueSmsFees`, `chargeDueInboxFees`, `recordDueVerifySmsUsage` (bills each organization for its codes from coss.com's shared numbers, reading coss.com's messages),
  `authenticateSchedulingSession` (from the token), `handleCalendarPush`, `completeCalendarAuthorization` (from the push's channel and the consent's state), `runDueCalendarDelegations`, `handleZoomDeauthorization` (from Zoom's signed event), `refreshIdleZoomConnections`, `runDueCalendarSyncs`, `runDueCalendarWrites`, `renewDueCalendarChannels`, `checkHostEditedEvents`, `runDueSchedulingNotifications`, `expireDueBookings`,
  `runDueFormDeliveries`, `runDueFormStoreCleanup`
  (and the dispatch jobs, from the job's `organizationId`); `@coss/sms/admin` is platform-level like `@coss/email/admin`. Server actions take only slugs +
  target ids and derive the org from `requireOrgPermission`; every Better Auth organization call passes `organizationId`
  explicitly (never rely on `session.activeOrganizationId`).
- **Client-safe modules** never import `@coss/db`: `@coss/compliance/catalog`, `@coss/dashboard-routes`, `@coss/risk/{schemas,env}`, `@coss/observability/*`, `@coss/auth/{permissions,slugs,constants,api-key-permissions,org-access}`, `@coss/push/schemas`, `@coss/forms/{schemas,env}`, `@coss/scheduling/branding`, `@coss/email/schemas`,
  `@coss/email/{broadcast-schemas,contact-schemas,inbox-schemas,subaccount-schemas,test-event-schemas,env,templates}`, `@coss/sms/{schemas,segments,env}`, `@coss/verify/schemas`, `@coss/hooks/{schemas,env}`, `@coss/reputation/schemas`, `@coss/screening/env`, `@coss/webhooks/{schemas,env}`, `@coss/ratelimit/buckets`, `@coss/versioning`, `@coss/retention`, `@coss/logs/{schemas,query}`, `@coss/billing/{catalog,schemas,engine,money,env,gate,wire}` (`gate` is types only), `@coss/ui/*`, `@coss/ui/theme.css`, `@coss/companion`, `@coss/migrate/templates`, `@coss/email-layout`. `@coss/webhooks`, `@coss/db/jobs`, `@coss/screening/{ai,runtime}`, `@coss/email/{runtime,ses,dispatch,domain-connect}`, `@coss/risk/{runtime,datasets}`, `@coss/signals/*`, `@coss/sms` (root, `./twilio`, `./runtime`, `./dispatch`, `./admin`), `@coss/push` (root, `./apns`), `@coss/notifications` and `@coss/billing` (root, `./metering`, `./runtime`, `./stripe`) are server-only; only `./stripe` (and `./runtime`) import the Stripe SDK. Server-only web
  modules start with `import "server-only"`.
- **Rate limits** (`@coss/ratelimit`): buckets are defined only in `BUCKETS` (`src/buckets.ts`); GCRA state is one
  key per bucket, `GCRA_SCRIPT` (Valkey) and `gcraStep` (memory) must stay in step (`test/store.test.ts` runs both).
  One consume call = one hash tag (`{scope:subject}`), so all its buckets share a scope and a cluster slot. The
  limiter applies each bucket's explicit `failureMode` on store errors and logs them: read-only API traffic allows,
  while authentication, writes, sends, quotas and public-ingress abuse controls deny. Never make it throw or block on Valkey. Never
  `FLUSH*`/`KEYS` (tests use random prefixes). Valkey time (`TIME`) is the clock, not the app's. API key buckets run
  after `requireApiKey` (a bad key spends no route bucket); key and aggregate-IP authentication buckets run before
  every database lookup, and `api.auth_failure` adds a client-IP penalty for bad keys. Send quotas are charged before `emailService.send` and refunded on replays and thrown errors.
  The worker charges `email.inbound.day` (per org, one per environment a message reaches) and **fails open** on
  purpose: a Valkey outage must never lose customer mail.
  Client IPs come only from `clientIpResolver` (`CLIENT_IP_HEADER`, rightmost-trusted `x-forwarded-for` entry) —
  never trust a raw header. Emails are hashed into keys. Better Auth's built-in limiter stays off
  (`rateLimit: { enabled: false }`): `apps/web/src/lib/auth-rate-limit.ts` wraps the `/api/auth` POST handler. The
  ElastiCache user's ACL (`valkey-bootstrap.ts` `APP_ACCESS`) must list every command the client and the scripts use
  (risk's `VELOCITY_SCRIPT` too). Changing it changes nothing live: re-run `valkey:bootstrap` in production (it
  rewrites the user's access string), or every script call with a new command fails with `NOPERM`/`ACL failure`.
  Per-org overrides are changed in the admin console's organization page through `changeRateLimitOverride`, which
  records a `rate_limit.override_*` audit event (bucket, previous and new rule) in the same transaction (the
  `ratelimit:set` script writes without one). Rule values are stored as `integer` (`MAX_RULE_VALUE`).

- **API versions** (`organization_api_version`, `webhook_endpoint.api_version`): an organization is pinned lazily to
  the latest version by its first authenticated request (`getOrganizationApiVersion`, insert-or-read; the dashboard
  only reads with `readOrganizationApiVersion`), and only moves forward (`setOrganizationApiVersion`, from org
  settings, `organization:update`). The outbox stores the latest-shape event; `renderWebhookPayload` renders it in
  the endpoint's version at every attempt and adds `api_version` (signed, in the body). Outbox payloads are typed
  `Stored*WebhookEvent` (no `api_version`). Never version error envelopes, and never transform in handlers.
- **Data retention** (`@coss/retention`): `RETENTION_DAYS` / `RETENTION_POLICY` are the only source of retention
  periods — the docs page (`/docs/data-retention`, `<RetentionTable />`/`<RetentionPeriod of>` MDX components, also
  rendered into `/llms*.txt`) and the dashboard's settings card render them, and each owning package's purge
  enforces them: `purgeExpiredEmails`/`purgeEmptyEmailBatches`/`purgeExpiredReputationRollups`/`purgeExpiredDedicatedIpRollups`/
  `purgeExpiredReceivedEmails`/`purgeExpiredFakeInboundObjects`/`purgeExpiredInboundDropCounters`/
  `purgeExpiredDmarcReports`/`purgeExpiredDmarcNotifications`/`purgeEmptyInboxThreads` (`@coss/email`;
  received content in S3 expires by the bucket's lifecycle rule, retention + 1 day),
  `purgeExpiredWebhookMessages`/`purgeExpiredWebhookListeners` (`@coss/webhooks`), `purgeExpiredScreenings` (`@coss/screening`),
  `purgeExpiredReputationNotifications`/`purgeExpiredReputationEvents` (`@coss/reputation`),
  `purgeExpiredRiskPersonalData`/`purgeExpiredRiskMemory`/`purgeExpiredRiskAssessments` (`@coss/risk`),
  `purgeExpiredPushNotifications` (`@coss/push`), `purgeExpiredNotifications` (`@coss/notifications`), `purgeExpiredVerifications` (`@coss/verify`), `purgeExpiredSmsMessages`/`purgeExpiredReceivedSms` (`@coss/sms`), `purgeExpiredMigrations`/`purgeAbandonedMigrationDrafts` (`@coss/migrate`),
  `purgeExpiredFormSubmissions`/`purgeExpiredFormFakeObjects` (`@coss/forms`; files of purged submissions go through
  `form_store_cleanup`, and the bucket's lifecycle rule expires objects after the longest retention + 1 day),
  `purgeExpiredAuthRows`/`purgeExpiredAdminAuditEvents` (`@coss/tenancy/retention`). The worker's `retention` loop
  (`apps/worker/src/retention.ts`, every 10 min, 1,000 rows per step, back-to-back while a step fills its batch) runs
  them in order (emails before their batches). Purges are system-level `DELETE … WHERE id IN (oldest batch)` with
  the condition re-checked, take `{ now, limit, scope }` (always pass `scope` in tests), and rely on cascades for
  children. Never purge: `queued`/`scheduled` emails, emails of an unfinished (`scheduled`/`sending`/`paused`) broadcast, webhook messages with a `pending` delivery (suspended orgs' are held),
  an org's latest reputation transition (notifications compare against it), `content_screening_counter` (the
  sampling sequence), suppressions (they outlive their email; the dashboard hides "View email" past the cutoff).
  The exception is Hooks: messages, deliveries and attempts are dropped by whole days with their partitions
  (`RETENTION_DAYS.hookMessages`, the worker's `partitions` loop), pending or not (the policy says so); its small tables
  have purges (`purgeExpiredHookIdempotencyKeys`, `purgeExpiredHookPortalSessions`, `purgeFinishedHookRecoveries`).
  Email retention must exceed the reputation window (≤ 30 days) and rollup recounts (31 days) — a test checks it. A
  new table either gets a catalog entry + purge or is covered by an existing "while your account exists" rule; changing
  a period changes the published policy, so treat it like a terms change.
- **Platform admin** (`/admin`, `@coss/tenancy/admin`): every admin page calls `requirePlatformAdmin()` itself — Next
  renders layouts and pages in parallel, so the layout's check alone would still stream the page's data to non-admins
  (verified). Actions use `requirePlatformAdminAction()` and record an `admin_audit_event` (append-only; no FKs; the
  actor's email is copied; deleted after `RETENTION_DAYS.adminAuditLog`); suspension/key revocation write it in the same transaction. Admins can't act on
  themselves; never send session tokens to the browser (revoke-one looks the token up server-side).
  Visibility: the overview, Sending (orgs by live volume), Emails (every org's emails, `@coss/email/admin`),
  Sign-ups (`RISK_SIGNUP_ENVIRONMENT_ID`'s assessments joined to accounts by address) and Screening pages. An
  email's content is only loaded by `revealEmailContentAction`, which records `email.view_content` in the
  admin audit log (never the organization's own: that would tip off an abuser); never render it with the page,
  and preview it with `UNTRUSTED_PREVIEW_HEAD` (no remote loads: a tracking pixel would tell the sender too).
  **Take down** (`takeDownOrganizationAction`, from `planOrganizationTakedown`) suspends the organization,
  revokes its keys and permanently bans members without another active organization (platform admins, the
  actor and already-banned users are kept), each step audited on its own, so it can be re-run.
  **Deploys** (`/admin/deploys`, `src/lib/deploys.ts`; pure parts in `deploy-runs.ts`) reads GitHub only through
  the coss.com Deploy app's installation token (Actions write, Contents read — never widen it): "Deploy now"
  dispatches `deploy.yml` for main and cancels push runs still before their migrate and deploy jobs; "Redeploy"
  dispatches `image_tag` for a commit a recent run deployed (re-checked server-side). It parses the runs' job names
  (`gate`, `build (…)`, `migrate`, `deploy`, its `Roll out` step) and the `run-name` of `image_tag`
  dispatches: change them together.
  The pages poll GitHub (`DEPLOY_REFRESH_SECONDS`): GETs are conditional (ETags; a 304 doesn't count against the
  token's 5,000 requests an hour) and the overview is shared for a few seconds, so keep new reads behind `github()`.
  A run's page (`[runId]`) also downloads failed jobs' logs (only their last 256 KB, excerpted by
  `failureLogExcerpt`; GitHub masks the workflow's secrets in them).
  **Security** (`/admin/security`, `src/lib/security-posture.ts`, pure parts in `security-posture-rules.ts`) is
  read-only and shows AWS's security services in plain language; a failed read is unknown, never fine.
- **Organization suspension** (`organization_suspension`, presence = suspended; reason is admin-internal): enforced in
  `authenticateApiKey` (`suspended` → 403 `organization_suspended`, only for otherwise-valid keys),
  `createEnvironmentApiKey`, webhook `claimDue` (held, not failed), the Better Auth org hooks
  (`packages/auth/AGENTS.md`), and the dashboard (`OrgContext.can()` / `requireOrgPermission` allow only reads). New
  write paths must respect it. Domain re-checks and SES event ingestion keep running. Gate dashboard controls with `can(…)` from `requireOrgMember`, not `orgRoleCan`.
- **Monitoring** (Sentry, `@coss/observability`): one cron monitor covers all worker loops (`worker-loops`, `watchLoops`: Sentry bills per monitor, so never one per loop) and `dispatch-backlog` reports messages waiting over 15 minutes; `GET /health/ready` is for uptime monitors only (load balancers stay on `/health`, which never touches the database). api and worker import `src/instrument.ts` first in `src/index.ts`
  (`@sentry/bun`; Bun has no runtime module hooks, so Hono gets `honoMiddleware(app)` in `createApp` — route names
  only, errors come from `onError`'s `console.error` — and pg/AWS calls aren't traced). The dashboard initializes
  its server in `register()` after env validation and exports `onRequestError`; both Next apps' browsers run
  `startBrowserMonitoring` (`src/instrumentation-client.ts`), which fetches the config from the dashboard's
  `/api/monitoring` (public in `proxy.ts`; the site proxies it in `next dev`) and tunnels envelopes through it
  (only the configured DSN's — never make it an open relay or add a Sentry origin to a CSP). The browser SDK is
  dynamically imported from `src/lib/monitoring-browser.ts` (named re-exports) only once that config arrives:
  client code never imports `@sentry/nextjs` statically, and never `import * as Sentry` (the namespace defeats
  tree-shaking and shipped Session Replay — ~150 KB gzipped — on every page). Every server runs
  `captureConsoleIntegration({ levels: ["error"] })`: a `console.error` with an error **is** a Sentry event, so
  packages keep logging handled failures that way and never import an SDK (expected outcomes don't belong in
  `console.error`). Every SDK uses `sentryOptions`: `DATA_COLLECTION` turns off what SDK v11 collects by default (bodies, IPs, cookies, query strings, AI prompts, local variables — never loosen it) and the `scrub*` hooks mask what remains; new URL secrets
  (tokens in paths) go in `SECRET_PATH_SEGMENTS` (`packages/observability/src/scrub.ts`). Tags: `request_id`,
  `organization_id`, `environment_id`, `api_key_id` (API), user id + `organization_id` (dashboard), `loop`,
  `email_id` (worker); never emails or content. No session replay (it would record customer data). The iOS app reports crashes on its own (`apps/mobile/AGENTS.md`, "Crash reporting"): no user, no replay.
- **Live keys** (`coss_live_`) require a verified email and can't be created while impersonating or reputation-suspended (`liveKeyRestriction`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/live-keys.ts`, enforced in the action and mirrored in the UI).
- **Email preview iframe** (`…/emails/[emailId]/page.tsx`): `sandbox=""`, `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`, CSP
  `PREVIEW_HEAD` prepended to `srcDoc`. Never add `allow-scripts` or `allow-same-origin`.
- **Product rules live next to their code** — read the `AGENTS.md` below before changing a product (each is loaded
  when you open files in its directory, so read it yourself when you work on the product from an app). The invariants
  that reach beyond them:
  - **Email** (`packages/email/AGENTS.md`: SES, suppressions, open/click tracking, one-click unsubscribe, custom
    tracking domains, scheduled and batch sends, attachments, generated text parts, reads, templates, receiving,
    inboxes): only the
    `coss_email_id` tag is ever set on SES messages; `SendEmail` is not idempotent (only throttling is retried); coss.com
    keeps the only suppression list and does its own open/click tracking — never turn SES's on; `email.html` always
    keeps the original (only the provider's copy is instrumented); templates are rendered at send and the `email`
    row stores the result. Inbox messages only point at received emails and emails (no content of their own),
    and live inboxes at the managed inbound domain never send.
    **Sub-accounts** (email for platforms): only a sub-account sends from its own domains (through
    its own tenant), sub-accounts send from the organization's domains only when shared; its bounces, complaints and
    screening blocks act on it alone (never suspend the organization), while the organization's own standing still
    counts all its sending.
  - **SMTP relay** (`apps/smtp/AGENTS.md`): never a raw MIME passthrough — every message goes through
    `EmailService.send` like `POST /v1/emails`; never move Bcc'd addresses into visible headers.
  - **Billing** (`packages/billing/AGENTS.md`): coss.com owns the catalog, contracts, rating and invoices; the provider
    (Stripe) only collects — never move pricing into Stripe objects. Products meter through `@coss/billing/metering`
    and take plan checks injected (`PlanGate`/`UsageGate`). Billing holds and reputation suspensions are independent.
  - **Webhooks** (`packages/webhooks/AGENTS.md`: delivery, the shared engine, endpoint health, secret rolls, log
    drains): deliver only through `createWebhookSender`; payloads never include bodies, headers, cc or bcc; every write
    of a secret column goes through `encryptSecret`, and `reencryptWebhookSecrets` covers every encrypted column.
  - **Hooks** (`packages/hooks/AGENTS.md`): day-partitioned tables with no FKs in or out; portal tokens never in a
    path, query or cookie.
  - **Reputation** (`packages/reputation/AGENTS.md`): a suspension is never lifted automatically (only
    `reinstateOrganization`); the worker never suspends coss.com's own organization.
  - **SMS** (`packages/sms/AGENTS.md`): opt-outs are always honored (STOP suppresses in every live environment);
    live sends only from an organization's `active` number whose registration is `approved`; Twilio's `SmartEncoded`
    stays off (coss.com bills the segments it counts); subaccount tokens only through `encryptSecret` (and
    `reencryptWebhookSecrets`); Twilio's negotiated rates and the markup are never committed (the repo is public).
  - **Content screening** (`packages/screening/AGENTS.md`): an unscreened sample is never sent; verdicts never store
    content and scores are admin-only.
  - **Logs** (`packages/logs/AGENTS.md`): `log_entry` rows only through `appendLogEntries`; bodies only through
    `redactBody`, never `Authorization`, cookies or attachment bytes.
  - **Push notifications** (`packages/push/AGENTS.md`): products call `enqueuePush(tx, …)` in the transaction that
    decided the event; devices belong to an app session, never to a user alone; the text passes through Apple, so names
    and counts only — never free-form text, addresses, URLs, scores or notes.
  - **Notification emails** (`packages/notifications/AGENTS.md`): every coss.com email renders with
    `@coss/email-layout` (never hand-built HTML); a new notification is a kind enqueued with
    `enqueueNotification(tx, …)` in the deciding transaction and rendered at send time, skipping
    itself when its news is stale; content is only what the dashboard already shows.
  - **Risk** (`packages/risk/AGENTS.md`): memory is HMAC-only (`RISK_HASH_KEY`); raw email, IP and user agent live
    only on `risk_assessment`; signals fail open.
  - **Sign** (`packages/sign/AGENTS.md`, `apps/sign/AGENTS.md`): the audit trail is append-only and hash-chained
    (`appendSignEvent` only, through `recordSignEvent` for its webhook and log line); coordinates are PDF points
    from the top left of the page as displayed; documents' bytes live only in the `DocumentStore`, never in API
    responses or webhooks; signing session tokens only in the URL fragment and an `Authorization` header (never a
    cookie, path or query); nothing a signer filled in changes after they sign.
  - **Verify** (`packages/verify/AGENTS.md`): codes are never stored (an HMAC keyed from `RISK_HASH_KEY`),
    logged or put in a webhook, and SMS/emails carrying them discard their bodies (live); a new
    verification passes the fraud guard before anything is sent or billed; shared-number SMS are
    coss.com's own messages, billed to the customer as `verify.sms` once they reached a carrier.
  - **Forms** (`packages/forms/AGENTS.md`): spam is answered exactly like a success; verification emails go only
    from the customer's verified sender, never coss.com's; live notification recipients are verified members or
    addresses on verified domains; hosted pages refuse fields asking for credentials and are screened when
    published; `/f/*` is served only on `FORMS_PUBLIC_URL`'s host in production, never coss.com's.
  - **Scheduling** (`packages/scheduling/AGENTS.md`): only `claims.ts` writes claims, in the fixed lock order;
    slots are computed only in Bun, through `isBookable`; calendars contribute busy intervals and nothing else, and an
    unreadable one never reads as free; answers never leave `getBooking`; coss.com never auto-cancels a booking.
  - **Support** (`packages/support/AGENTS.md`): `From` proves nothing, so a match never grants access by
    itself: customers see only a confirmed organization's tickets, an unverified message stays rep-only, we
    always reply to `From` and never copy inbound Cc from unauthenticated mail; notes never leave
    `@coss/support/admin`; threads never match on a subject.
  - **HIPAA mode** (`packages/compliance/AGENTS.md`): a new vendor or a new path that sends customer content
    outside AWS needs a gate and an entry in `HIPAA_VENDORS`; a new sender that can fall back to coss.com's
    environment passes `hipaaOrigin` for organizations in the mode; it is never a billing entitlement.
  - **Organization deletion** (`packages/tenancy/AGENTS.md`): a table with many rows per organization belongs in
    `deleteOrganizationData`, anything held outside Postgres in `releaseProviderResources`.

## Local dev

- Postgres.app: `createdb coss && createdb coss_test`; URLs like `postgres://<macOS user>@localhost:5432/coss` (no
  password — the `postgres:postgres` form in `.env.example` is CI's).
- `bun run db:migrate && bun run db:seed`, then sign in at http://localhost:3000 as `demo@coss.local` /
  `coss-demo-password` (platform admin; org `acme` with the verified fake domain `acme.test`, project `default`).
  Each seed run prints a new `COSS_API_KEY`.
- Send with `COSS_API_KEY=… COSS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 bun packages/sdk/examples/send-email.ts` (live keys:
  add `COSS_FROM=hello@acme.test`; `COSS_TO=bounce@simulator.amazonses.com` simulates a bounce). Webhook endpoints
  may be `http://127.0.0.1:…` locally; the worker (part of `bun run dev`) delivers them.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- Login shells put `~/.local/bin` first (Node.js 24 and Bun 1.4.2). `node` earlier on `PATH` (`/exec-daemon/node`) is Node 22; Next.js and the Better Auth CLI need 24.
- The environment `start` script already brings up PostgreSQL 18 (`postgres:postgres` on `localhost:5432`, databases `coss` and `coss_test`), Valkey 8 on `localhost:6379`, a root `.env` (created once), and migrations. It runs `db:seed` when `demo@coss.local` is missing or `.env` has no `COSS_API_KEY` line (a database snapshot can outlive `.env`; seed is idempotent and mints a new development key). It then runs `bunx turbo run dev --ui=stream` in tmux session `coss-dev` (log `/tmp/coss-dev.log`): dashboard `:3000`, API `:3001`, site `:3002`, portal `:3003`, SMTP `:2465`/`:2587`, and the worker. Re-running start when that key line is already present does not mint another key or a second dev session.
- Seed appends `COSS_API_KEY` and `COSS_BASE_URL` to `.env`. Sign in as in local dev. Turborepo remote cache is not set up here — do not run `turbo login` (README, "Remote cache").
- Run `bun run test` from the repo root so Bun loads that `.env` before Turborepo. Dashboard tests that import `apps/web/src/env.ts` need `DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `API_PUBLIC_URL`, and `WEBHOOK_SECRETS_KEY` in the process environment. CI sets those in the workflow; a login shell does not, and a bare `turbo run test` then fails those files with `Invalid environment variables`.

## Known limitations (v0)

- Sends are asynchronous: `POST /v1/emails` stores the email and its `email-dispatch` pg-boss job in one transaction
  and returns 202 `queued`; the worker runs `dispatch`, which claims the email (sets `provider`) before calling the
  provider, so a job that runs twice never sends twice. Retries with the same `Idempotency-Key` replay the email in its
  current state (queued included). If a worker dies after the claim (or SES's answer is lost: a timeout or reset
  connection, `UncertainSendError`), the row stays `queued` until the stale-claim sweep
  (15 min) marks it `sent` (if SES reported it) or `failed`/`dispatch_interrupted` (a late SES `Send` event still
  repairs it). An email still unclaimed after 10 min (its job exhausted its retries) is re-enqueued, and after 1 hour
  (`UNCLAIMED_FAIL_MS`) it is `failed`/`dispatch_failed` with an `email.failed` webhook — so a worker outage longer than
  an hour fails the emails queued during it instead of sending them late. Sends need the worker running.
- Logs are best effort: request lines are buffered (up to 1 s, dropped if the database is down), requests with an
  invalid or missing key can't be attributed and aren't logged, and free-text search is a substring match. Facets and
  the histogram scan the selected range, so very long ranges on busy environments are slow (no rollups yet).
- Webhook deliveries are not ordered (use `data.occurred_at`; SES itself may publish a complaint before the
  delivery). SES complaints may list every recipient on the complaining domain (and each of them gets suppressed).
  SES never suppresses mailbox-simulator addresses, and with tenant-level suppression `suppressionlist@simulator.amazonses.com` is a plain hard bounce — only
  the fake provider simulates `suppressed` (via that address).
- Content screening only samples (a sender can still get unsampled messages through, until the random sample or
  bounces/complaints catch up) and its scores are uncalibrated model probabilities; thresholds were chosen, not
  measured against labeled coss.com traffic. Injected text in a message can lower its scores. An org-wide suspension from
  one false positive needs an admin to reinstate.
- Tracking does not filter bots: mail clients that prefetch images (e.g. Apple Mail Privacy Protection) inflate opens
  and link scanners inflate clicks. Providers send one message to every recipient, so hits on emails with several
  recipients have `recipient: null`.
- Rate-limit outage behavior is explicit per bucket: read-only API traffic fails open, while security and cost
  controls fail closed. Override changes take up to a minute (per-process cache). Without `CLIENT_IP_HEADER`, public
  unauthenticated entry points use a per-process aggregate subject instead of a client IP. Sign-in is also limited per email address, so
  someone hammering an address delays its owner's sign-in for as long as they keep at it (accepted).
- SSO domains must be verified **email** domains, so an organization that signs in with a domain it doesn't send
  from still adds it under Domains (which creates an SES identity). OIDC IdPs must be public `https://` hosts.
  SAML errors after the IdP step land on the callback URL (`?error=`), not on `/sso`. The SAML path is covered by
  Better Auth's own tests only (ours drive OIDC against oauth2-mock-server).
- Directory sync only manages members and admins: owners are never added, demoted or removed by it (a directory
  deactivating an owner shows a warning on the SCIM page), and groups only map to roles. Directory users must sign
  in through the organization's SSO provider, so SCIM needs one.
  Disconnecting keeps every member. Profile changes of linked (pre-existing) accounts are not synced.
- Next's cache is per task (nothing uses ISR or `revalidateTag` yet; add a shared `cacheHandler` first).
- Abuse prevention is best-effort: the disposable list only knows public burner services (refresh it), one-account-
  per-mailbox folds only well-known providers' dots/`+tags`, the DNS check lets every lookup failure through, and a
  Cloudflare siteverify outage blocks password sign-in, sign-up and reset (passkeys and SSO keep working).
- Accepted: sign-up email enumeration. A user ban does not cut off their orgs' organization API
  keys (only their personal keys) — suspend the organization. Suspension does not pause the SES tenant itself;
  already-queued immediate sends finish, while scheduled sends wait for the suspension to be lifted.

- Receiving is SES-region bound (SES receiving regions only) and accepts any mail for a verified domain of the
  account, then drops what doesn't route (no SMTP-time rejection, no bounces). Over an organization's daily inbound
  limit mail is dropped and only counted. Received `cid:` inline images don't render in the dashboard preview.
  Content written for a message whose row never committed (a crash in between) stays until the lifecycle rule.
- Account emails go to unverified addresses by design (sign-up verification, invitations) from coss.com's own
  organization, so bounces from made-up sign-up addresses count against that organization's reputation like any
  customer's — but the worker never suspends it on its own (`systemOrganizationId`: the guard only warns it and a
  screening block only flags its message), and neither can platform admins (the dashboard reads the same variable).
  If it was suspended before this rule, an admin can still lift it. Sign-up and verification
  resends are rate limited per IP and address; invitations only by Better Auth's pending-invitation limit per org.
- Reputation rollups are kept per hour of sending, so late events for an old hour make the next evaluation
  recount that whole hour. Emails are purged 45 days after creation, so a send scheduled weeks ahead can be gone
  before it leaves a 30-day window; its closed hour keeps its rolled-up counts unless a later event forces a recount. A send already past `authorizeLiveSender` when the org is suspended still goes out.
  Customers are told by banner, page, API, webhooks and a notification email to owners/admins — only for warnings
  and suspensions (not recoveries or reinstatements), and only once the worker's `NOTIFICATIONS_*` variables point
  at a verified sender of coss.com's own organization.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
