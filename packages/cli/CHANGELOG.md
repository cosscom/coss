# coss-cli

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9978333: `coss init --agents`: adds a short section on coss.com for coding agents (where the docs are, what the development key does, how to test) to the project's `AGENTS.md`, or its `CLAUDE.md` when it has no `AGENTS.md`. Running it again updates the section. `--json` reports the file as `agents_file`.
- 57cc163: Scoped API keys: `coss.environment.get()` now returns the key's `api_key.access` (`full` or `restricted`) and `api_key.permissions` (`resource:action` strings, e.g. `email:send`). The MCP server's `get_account_status` reports them and its permission errors say the key is restricted; `coss whoami` prints the key's access.
- fb711e1: `coss sms send`: a test text message (`--to`, or `--simulate delivered|invalid|filtered|opted-out|reply` for the SMS simulator; `--wait` follows it to its outcome and shows the simulator's reply).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e13f0e4: `coss.email.templates.render(template, { version, locale, variables })` renders a template's draft (or a published version) as a send would, without sending (`POST /v1/email_templates/{id}/render`). The CLI gets `coss domains list|add|get|verify` (DNS records as a table or zone-file lines with `--format bind`; `verify --wait` follows the domain until it's verified) and templates as code: `coss templates list|pull|push|preview` (a folder per template, `push --watch` and `--publish`, `preview --var … --open`).
- 2857473: `coss/diagnose` explains an email's delivery: `diagnose(coss, id)` reads the email, its events and its account context, and `diagnoseEmail` is the pure part (moved from `coss-mcp`, which now uses it and still re-exports it). The CLI gets `coss emails list`, `coss emails get`, `coss emails events` and `coss emails diagnose`, and `coss inbox` (the inbound domain, then received emails as they arrive) with `coss inbox get`.
- e2ddd7a: `coss hooks …`: create Hooks applications, event types and endpoints (`endpoints add` prints the signing secret), send messages (`--data`, `-F` fields, or the event type's example), follow deliveries and their attempts, retry one, and open an application's portal. `coss risk …`: assess an event and see the decision, score and reasons (sandbox fixtures produce each decision), list assessments and the review queue, send feedback, and manage the allow and block lists. Help and errors for groups inside groups (`coss hooks apps`) now name their own commands.
- 3a02992: `coss init` sets a project up: it installs `coss` with the project's package manager and writes a new development key, approved in the dashboard and named after the project, to `.env.local` (Next.js) or `.env`. `coss profiles list` and `coss use <profile>` show and switch the saved profiles, and `coss open [page]` opens the environment's dashboard page. A daily update notice says when a newer coss-cli exists (`COSS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` turns it off), and completion offers saved profile names.
- 78b99d3: Test webhook events: `coss.webhookEvents.test({ type, data })` (`POST /v1/webhook_events/test`) sends a sample event of a type to the environment's subscribed endpoints and open listeners, exactly like a real one (sandbox keys; every type but the live-only `domain.*`, `account.*` and `billing.*`). The SDK also exports `WEBHOOK_EVENT_TYPES`, `TEST_WEBHOOK_EVENT_TYPES` and `isLiveOnlyEventType`. The CLI gets `coss trigger <event-type>` (with `--data` and `-F`, so `coss listen` + `coss trigger` exercises a local handler), and `coss webhooks list`, `coss webhooks deliveries <endpoint>` and `coss webhooks retry <endpoint> <delivery>`.
- 8fea903: `coss.request(method, path, options)` calls any endpoint by its path (for one the SDK has no method for yet), with the client's key, version, timeout and retries; POST, PUT and PATCH are retried only with `retry: true`. The CLI's new `coss api <path>` uses it: `-f`/`-F` fields, `--input` bodies (or stdin), `--paginate` and `--raw`. Also `coss completion bash|zsh|fish`, and every command's `--help` is now generated from its flags.

- 11bed1a: The coss.com CLI (`npm i -g coss-cli`, command `coss`): `coss login` (in the browser, or `--manual` with an API key), `logout`, `whoami`, `coss emails send` (test emails, `--simulate bounced|complained|delivered|suppressed`, `--wait`), `coss logs tail`, and `coss listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhooks` to receive the environment's webhook events on your machine, signed with a stable `whsec_` secret.
