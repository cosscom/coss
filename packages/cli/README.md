# coss-cli

The command line for [coss.com](https://coss.com): sign in, send test emails and text messages, follow
your environment's log, and receive its webhook events on your machine.

```sh
npm install -g coss-cli    # or: npx coss-cli <command>
coss login
coss listen --forward-to localhost:3000/webhooks
coss trigger email.bounced    # in another terminal: a test event, forwarded by coss listen
```

## Install without Node.js

Each release's [GitHub release](https://github.com/cosscom/coss/releases) (`coss-cli@<version>`)
also has standalone executables (Bun's runtime built in) for macOS, Linux (glibc and musl) and
Windows, arm64 and x64, with a `SHA256SUMS`:

```sh
brew install cosscom/tap/coss                 # macOS and Linux; completions included
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosscom/coss/main/packages/cli/install.sh | sh
```

`install.sh` picks the archive for the machine, checks it against `SHA256SUMS` and installs `coss`
into `~/.local/bin` (`COSS_INSTALL_DIR`; `COSS_VERSION` for another version). The musl builds need
`libstdc++` (`apk add libstdc++` on Alpine). macOS executables are signed with coss.com's Developer
ID and notarized by Apple (since 0.3.0), so one downloaded with a browser runs without a warning.

## Commands

| Command | |
| --- | --- |
| `coss login` | Opens the dashboard, where you pick an environment; the CLI gets a new API key of it. `--manual` pastes an existing key instead; `--no-browser` (the default over SSH) shows a link and asks for the code it displays. |
| `coss logout` | Removes the saved key, and revokes it if `coss login` created it (`--revoke` revokes a pasted one too; `--all` signs every profile out). |
| `coss whoami` | The key in use, where it comes from, and its organization, project and environment. |
| `coss profiles list` | The saved profiles: each one's environment, whether `coss login` created its key or it was pasted, and which is the default. |
| `coss use <profile>` | Makes a saved profile the default. |
| `coss init` | Sets the project in the current directory up: installs `coss` with its package manager (`--no-install` doesn't) and writes a new development key, approved in the dashboard and named after the project, to `.env.local` (Next.js) or `.env` (`--env-file` picks another). A key already there is kept unless `--force`. It adds notes on coss.com for coding agents to the project's `AGENTS.md` (`--no-agents` skips them) and prints the one next step for the key. |
| `coss open [page]` | Opens the environment's page in the dashboard: `overview`, `emails`, `logs`, `webhooks`, `api-keys`, `domains`, `billing`, … (`--print` prints the URL). |
| `coss emails send` | A test email: `--to`, or `--simulate delivered\|bounced\|complained\|suppressed` for the mailbox simulator; `--template` with `--var name=value`; `--wait` follows it to its outcome (up to `--timeout`, 60 s). |
| `coss emails list` | The environment's emails, newest first, with where each stands. Filter with `--to`, `--status`, `--recipient-status`, `-q`, `--category`, `--batch`, `--since`/`--until`; `--limit` (20). |
| `coss emails get <id>` | An email: sender, recipients and their statuses, failure, tracking, attachments; `--text` or `--html` prints a body alone. |
| `coss emails events <id>` | Its delivery events, with the receiving server's answers. |
| `coss emails diagnose <id>` | Whether it was delivered and, if not, why and what to do (or `--to <address>` for the newest email to it). |
| `coss sms send` | A test text message: `--to +14155550123`, or `--simulate delivered\|invalid\|filtered\|opted-out\|reply` for the SMS simulator (sandbox keys); `--from` (default for sandbox keys `+14155550100`; live keys need one of your registered numbers), `--body`; `--wait` follows it to its outcome (and shows the simulator's reply). |
| `coss logs tail` | New lines of the environment's log as they arrive: API requests, email events, webhook attempts. Filter with `--source`, `--level`, `--type`, `--status`, `-q`; `--since 15m` starts earlier; `--interval` sets the poll interval (2000 ms). |
| `coss inbox` | The environment's inbound domain, then each email it receives as it arrives (`--since`, `--interval`). |
| `coss inbox get <id>` | A received email: verdicts, attachments and its text (`--html`, `--headers`); `--raw > message.eml` saves the message as received. |
| `coss listen` | Receives the environment's webhook events and forwards each one to `--forward-to`, signed like coss.com signs real deliveries. Verify them with `verifyWebhook` from the `coss` SDK and the signing secret it prints (it stays the same for the profile). `--header "Name: value"` adds a header to forwarded requests. |
| `coss trigger <event-type>` | A test event of that type, sent to the environment's subscribed endpoints and `coss listen` listeners like a real one (sandbox keys; every type but `domain.*`, `account.*`, `billing.*`). `--data '{…}'` and `-F name=value` (dotted names, JSON values) change its `data`. |
| `coss webhooks list` | The environment's webhook endpoints: URL, state and event types. |
| `coss webhooks add <url>` | Creates an endpoint and writes its signing secret to the project env file as `COSS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (`--events`, `--description`, `--force`). |
| `coss webhooks deliveries <endpoint>` | An endpoint's deliveries, newest first (`--status failed`, `--event <id>`, `--limit`). |
| `coss webhooks retry <endpoint> <delivery>` | Sends a finished delivery to its endpoint once more. |
| `coss hooks apps list`, `coss hooks apps create <name>` | [Hooks](https://coss.com/docs/hooks) applications (`--uid`, `--metadata`). Every `<app>` below is an application's id or uid. |
| `coss hooks event-types list`, `coss hooks event-types create <name>` | The event types messages are sent as (`--description`, `--schema`, `--example`). |
| `coss hooks endpoints list <app>`, `coss hooks endpoints add <app> --url <url>` | An application's endpoints; `add` prints the new endpoint's signing secret (`--types`, `--rate-limit`). |
| `coss hooks send <app> <event-type>` | Sends a message: the payload from `--data '{…}'`, `-F name=value` fields, or the type's first example. |
| `coss hooks deliveries <app>`, `coss hooks attempts <app> <delivery>`, `coss hooks retry <app> <delivery>` | Deliveries (`--endpoint`, `--message`, `--status`), each HTTP request of one, and one more attempt. |
| `coss hooks portal <app>` | A portal link for the application's users (`--open`, `--read-only`, `--expires-in`). |
| `coss risk assess --event <event>` | Assesses an event (`--email`, `--ip`, `--user`, `--content`, `--data '{…}'`…) and prints the decision, score and reasons. Sandbox fixtures (`192.0.2.1`, `disposable.test`, `[coss-test:spam]`…) produce each decision. |
| `coss risk assessments`, `coss risk feedback <assessment> --outcome <outcome>` | Assessments (`--review open`: the review queue), and what a user turned out to be. |
| `coss risk lists list`, `coss risk lists add <allow\|block> <type> <value>`, `coss risk lists remove <entry>` | The allow and block lists (`--note`, `--expires 7d`). |
| `coss domains list` | The organization's sending domains and their status. |
| `coss domains add <domain>` | Adds a domain and prints the DNS records to publish (`--format bind` prints zone-file lines). |
| `coss domains get <domain>` | A domain's records and what the last DNS check saw (verified, missing, mismatch). `--format bind` too. |
| `coss domains verify <domain>` | Checks the records now; `--wait` keeps checking until the domain is verified, saying which records are still missing (up to `--timeout`, 600 s). |
| `coss templates list` | The environment's email templates. |
| `coss templates pull [<template>...]` | Writes drafts to `--dir` (`templates`): a folder per template with `template.json` and `<locale>.subject.txt`, `<locale>.html`, `<locale>.txt`. |
| `coss templates push [<path>...]` | Saves drafts from those files, finding templates by alias (creating missing ones); `--publish` publishes after, `--watch` pushes again whenever a file changes. |
| `coss templates preview <template>` | Renders the draft (or `--version`) without sending: `--var name=value`, `--locale`, `--open` shows the HTML, `--output` saves it. |
| `coss api <path>` | Any endpoint of the API, with the CLI's key: `coss api domains`, `coss api -X POST domains/<id>/verify`. `-f name=value` (strings) and `-F name=value` (JSON values, `@file`) are query parameters for GET and DELETE and the JSON body otherwise; `--input file.json` (or `-` for stdin) sends a body as is; `--paginate` prints every item of a list; `--raw` prints a body that isn't JSON. |
| `coss completion <shell>` | The completion script for `bash`, `zsh` or `fish`, e.g. `eval "$(coss completion zsh)"` in `~/.zshrc`. |

Every command takes `--json` (one JSON object per line), `--profile <name>` and `--help`; `coss --version`
prints the CLI's. Results go to stdout, progress to stderr. Exit codes: `0` done, `1` failed, `2` wrong usage,
`130` stopped with Ctrl-C.

## Configuration

| Variable | |
| --- | --- |
| `COSS_API_KEY` | Use this key instead of a saved profile (CI, scripts). |
| `COSS_PROFILE` | The saved profile to use (default: the one `coss login` saved first). |
| `COSS_BASE_URL` | Another API origin, e.g. `http://localhost:3001`. Remembered by `coss login`. |
| `COSS_DASHBOARD_URL` | Another dashboard for `coss login`, e.g. `http://localhost:3000`. |
| `COSS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | `1` turns the update notice off. |

Keys are saved in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/coss/config.json` (`~/.config/coss`, `%APPDATA%\coss` on Windows),
readable only by you. No flag takes a key: command lines are visible to other local processes.

Once a day, in a terminal, the CLI asks the npm registry for its latest version (a plain `GET` of
`https://registry.npmjs.org/coss-cli/latest`, nothing else is sent) and prints one line on stderr
when there is a newer one. It never runs with `--json`, in CI (`CI`) or when stderr isn't a terminal.
