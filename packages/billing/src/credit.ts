/**
 * Credit control: usage is invoiced after it happens, and coss.com pays its providers either way.
 * Two things bound what an account can run up (the worker's `billing-credit` loop):
 *
 * - **Threshold charges.** Unbilled usage reaching the threshold is invoiced and charged at once
 *   (`threshold` invoices). The invoice funds a `threshold` credit grant, so the rating engine stays
 *   the only thing that prices usage: the month's invoice re-rates the whole month and draws the
 *   grant down, and a charge that fails is still owed once, on its own invoice.
 * - **The credit limit.** What could still be lost (unbilled usage, unpaid invoices and threshold
 *   charges too recent to have survived a dispute) stays under a limit that grows with settled
 *   payments. Over it, a `credit_limit` hold pauses live sending. A stolen card that pays every
 *   charge is therefore still capped: its payments count against the limit until they settle.
 *
 * Self-serve accounts charged automatically are under it; contracts and net terms only when an admin
 * sets a limit (`billing_account.credit_limit_cents`). System-level: spans organizations.
