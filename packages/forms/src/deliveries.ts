/**
 * The worker's `forms` loop: what accepted (and pending) submissions still owe, one
 * `form_delivery` row per kind — the owner's notification email, the contact, the submitter's
 * verification email. System-level: `scope` narrows it in tests. Rows are leased by moving
 * `next_attempt_at` forward (a crashed worker's lease simply runs out), retried with backoff and
 * given up after `MAX_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS`. A suspended organization's deliveries wait until it is
 * reinstated: coss.com's sender must never carry its mail.
