### Minor Changes

- daf97ff: Inboxes: the MCP server gains `create_inbox`, `list_inboxes`, `list_inbox_threads`, `get_inbox_thread`, `send_inbox_message` and `reply_to_inbox_message`; the CLI gains `coss inboxes list|create|threads|thread|reply`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 57397ff: Setup status for agents, error hints, and one project key.
  
  `describeSetup` reports a from address that will succeed and one next step. API errors can include `hint` (a fix, often with a docs URL), and the SDK copies it onto `CossError`. `coss init` writes agent notes by default, points at the project's mail library or framework driver, and prints that setup. `coss listen` writes `COSS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` into the project env file. `coss-mcp` loads a development key from that file and adds setup, risk, Hooks and template tools.
- 2b6c98e: Publish a template and register a webhook endpoint from the tools an agent already uses.
  
  `publish_email_template` publishes the draft revision it just read. `create_webhook_endpoint` and `coss webhooks add` create an endpoint once and write its signing secret to the project env file as `COSS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. A URL that already has an endpoint is left as it is. `coss init` snippets send to the mailbox simulator from the address setup reports.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9978333: Docs tools: `search_docs` searches coss.com's guides, SDK pages and API reference, and `read_docs` reads a page as Markdown (an API operation's parameters, bodies, responses and samples included). Both work without an API key: `COSS_API_KEY` is now optional, and without it the server offers only these two tools (and explains how to get a key) instead of exiting. `createCossMcpServer`'s `coss` option is optional for the same reason, and its new `docs` option points the docs tools elsewhere.
- 57cc163: Scoped API keys: `coss.environment.get()` now returns the key's `api_key.access` (`full` or `restricted`) and `api_key.permissions` (`resource:action` strings, e.g. `email:send`). The MCP server's `get_account_status` reports them and its permission errors say the key is restricted; `coss whoami` prints the key's access.
- fb711e1: SMS tools: `send_sms`, `cancel_sms`, `find_sms`, `get_sms`, `diagnose_sms` (what a message's status or failure code means and what to do), `list_received_sms`, `list_sms_numbers`, `check_sms_suppression`, `add_sms_suppression` and `remove_sms_suppression`; `diagnoseSms` is exported.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 2857473: `coss/diagnose` explains an email's delivery: `diagnose(coss, id)` reads the email, its events and its account context, and `diagnoseEmail` is the pure part (moved from `coss-mcp`, which now uses it and still re-exports it). The CLI gets `coss emails list`, `coss emails get`, `coss emails events` and `coss emails diagnose`, and `coss inbox` (the inbound domain, then received emails as they arrive) with `coss inbox get`.

  `unsubscribe` suppression reason. The MCP server's send tool takes `tracking.unsubscribe`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 57a79b8: First release of `coss-mcp`, the coss.com MCP server: coding agents can find emails and diagnose their delivery (`diagnose_email`), send test emails, manage suppressions and domains, inspect webhook deliveries, received emails and logs, and check the account's reputation and billing standing. Run it with `npx -y coss-mcp` and `COSS_API_KEY`.
