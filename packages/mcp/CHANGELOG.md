# coss-mcp

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- a3bb0d7: Name who covers while a scheduling host is away: `delegates` on `coss.scheduling.outOfOffice` entries can be booked in their place, inside the same event type, keeping to how a booking's routed. The MCP server's `create_scheduling_out_of_office` takes `delegates` and `existing_bookings`.
- The MCP server's `create_scheduling_session` can make a team lead's page with `manager_hosts`, and `coss open` knows the out of office, holidays and reassignments pages.
- 867d240: Reassign scheduling bookings: `coss.scheduling.bookings.reassign` gives any kind of booking to another host, keeping its id and time, and `reassignCandidates` says who could take it and why not. Adds a `scheduling.booking.reassigned` webhook with `previous_host_ids`, `reassignment_enabled` on event types and `name_host_in_attendee_emails` in settings. The MCP server gets reassign and out of office tools, and the CLI `coss scheduling reassign`, `candidates` and `ooo`.
- 7970389: Move many scheduling bookings at once: `coss.scheduling.reassignments` previews who each would go to, runs it in the background with an outcome per booking, and can cancel and undo. Out of office entries take `existing_bookings: "reassign"` to start one. Adds a `scheduling.reassignment.completed` webhook. The MCP server gets preview, create, get, cancel and undo tools, and the CLI `coss scheduling reassign-many`, `reassignments` and `reassignment`.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 2012767: Setup and diagnosis know every product. `fetchSetupReport(coss, { product })`, the MCP server's `get_setup` and `coss init --product` say what a product still needs or how to try it in a sandbox, and report `products` and `products_in_use` next to the fields they had. `coss/diagnose` adds SMS, Verify, Sign, Forms, Hooks and Scheduling, as MCP tools (`diagnose_verification`, `diagnose_sign_request`, `diagnose_form_submission`, `diagnose_hook_delivery`, `diagnose_scheduling_slots`) and CLI commands (`coss sms diagnose`, `coss verify diagnose`, `coss sign diagnose`, `coss forms diagnose`, `coss hooks diagnose`, `coss scheduling diagnose`). The MCP server also gets `list_email_templates`, log drain and sub-account tools, `api_get` (a read-only fallback for any `/v1/` path), output schemas on `get_setup` and the diagnose tools, and its first prompts and resources.
- a7ff535: Verify's settings have an API: `coss.verify.settings.get()` and `.update()`. The MCP server gets tools for marketing (contacts, audiences, segments, topics, broadcasts), Verify and Sign, and more for Forms, Scheduling, Hooks and Risk, plus `COSS_MCP_TOOLSETS` to offer fewer of them. The CLI gets `coss verify`, `coss contacts`, `coss broadcasts` and `coss sign`, and more of `coss sms`, `coss forms` and `coss scheduling`.
- 411767c: `coss.environment.get()` and the MCP server's `get_account_status` say whether the organization is in HIPAA mode (`organization.hipaa_mode`). The MCP server explains `hipaa_mode_restriction` refusals.
- cdec0a9: The server is also hosted at `https://api.coss.com/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, stateless, authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer <API key>`), for clients that can't start a local process. `coss-mcp/http` is its handler, and `createCossMcpServer` takes `transport: "hosted"`, which offers no tool that touches files. `server.json` describes both for the MCP registry.
- 17ac7bc: Scheduling bookings have a readable history: `coss.scheduling.bookings.events(id)`, the MCP server's `list_scheduling_booking_events` and `coss scheduling booking-events`. A cancelled booking says who cancelled it in `cancelled_by`, and `bookings.cancel` takes an optional `reason`, which only retrieving that booking returns. `bookings.cancel`'s second argument is now its parameters, and request options moved to the third, as on `series.cancel`.
- 4168d9e: Scheduling slots explain themselves. `coss.scheduling.slots.explain(eventType, { start })`, the MCP server's `explain_scheduling_slot` and `coss scheduling slots explain` say whether one start can be booked right now and, host by host, why not. Slots also carry `seats_left` for group event types.
- f099789: Scheduling bookings can have guests: set an event type's `max_guests`, then pass `guests` when booking. They're emailed about it, and `coss.scheduling.attendees.eraseByEmail()` erases someone known only by their address. An event type's `host_calendar_details: "full"` puts its title and who's coming on hosts' calendars instead of a neutral "Appointment". The MCP server's `create_scheduling_booking` takes `guests`.
- 6d31dd3: Scheduling reminders: `reminders` on `coss.scheduling.settings` and event types say what goes out around a booking, timed from its start, end or any change to it, to attendees, hosts, fixed addresses or a webhook, in your own words if you like. `coss.scheduling.bookings.notifications()` lists what was queued and why anything wasn't sent. New webhooks: `scheduling.booking.started`, `scheduling.booking.ended` and `scheduling.booking.reminder`. Hosts take a `phone`, event types take `notifications`, and settings take `email_reply_to`. The MCP server gets `get_scheduling_reminders`, `save_scheduling_reminders`, `list_scheduling_booking_notifications` and `mark_scheduling_no_show`, and the CLI `coss scheduling reminders`, `notifications` and `no-show`.

### Patch Changes

- 476ed3c: An empty or whitespace `COSS_MCP_TOOLSETS` now means every tool, as an unset one does, instead of only the core tools. The Claude Code plugin's new optional `toolsets` setting passes it through, and is empty unless someone picks toolsets.
- 7452381: Avoid regular expressions that slow down on unusual input when trimming base URLs and reading From headers.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 7afbbef: Forms: the MCP server's `list_forms`, `list_form_submissions` and `get_form_submission` tools (submitted
  values labelled untrusted), and the CLI's `coss forms list` and `coss forms submissions <form>`
  (`--status`, `--limit`, `--json`).
- a2ed56a: Adds `coss.scheduling`: hosts, schedules, event types, slots, availability search, bookings, holds, recurring
  series, calendars, sessions and settings. `coss/scheduling` embeds the hosted pages (`mountBooker`,
  `mountHostPortal`).
  
  `coss-mcp` gets tools to list hosts, slots and bookings and to cancel a booking; `coss-cli` gets
  `coss scheduling hosts` and `coss scheduling bookings`.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 57397ff: Setup status for agents, error hints, and one project key.
  
  `describeSetup` reports a from address that will succeed and one next step. API errors can include `hint` (a fix, often with a docs URL), and the SDK copies it onto `CossError`. `coss init` writes agent notes by default, points at the project's mail library or framework driver, and prints that setup. `coss listen` writes `COSS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` into the project env file. `coss-mcp` loads a development key from that file and adds setup, risk, Hooks and template tools.
- 2b6c98e: Publish a template and register a webhook endpoint from the tools an agent already uses.
  
  `publish_email_template` publishes the draft revision it just read. `create_webhook_endpoint` and `coss webhooks add` create an endpoint once and write its signing secret to the project env file as `COSS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. A URL that already has an endpoint is left as it is. `coss init` snippets send to the mailbox simulator from the address setup reports.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9978333: Docs tools: `search_docs` searches coss.com's guides, SDK pages and API reference, and `read_docs` reads a page as Markdown (an API operation's parameters, bodies, responses and samples included). Both work without an API key: `COSS_API_KEY` is now optional, and without it the server offers only these two tools (and explains how to get a key) instead of exiting. `createCossMcpServer`'s `coss` option is optional for the same reason, and its new `docs` option points the docs tools elsewhere.
- 57cc163: Scoped API keys: `coss.environment.get()` now returns the key's `api_key.access` (`full` or `restricted`) and `api_key.permissions` (`resource:action` strings, e.g. `email:send`). The MCP server's `get_account_status` reports them and its permission errors say the key is restricted; `coss whoami` prints the key's access.
- fb711e1: SMS tools: `send_sms`, `cancel_sms`, `find_sms`, `get_sms`, `diagnose_sms` (what a message's status or failure code means and what to do), `list_received_sms`, `list_sms_numbers`, `check_sms_suppression`, `add_sms_suppression` and `remove_sms_suppression`; `diagnoseSms` is exported.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 2857473: `coss/diagnose` explains an email's delivery: `diagnose(coss, id)` reads the email, its events and its account context, and `diagnoseEmail` is the pure part (moved from `coss-mcp`, which now uses it and still re-exports it). The CLI gets `coss emails list`, `coss emails get`, `coss emails events` and `coss emails diagnose`, and `coss inbox` (the inbound domain, then received emails as they arrive) with `coss inbox get`.

  `unsubscribe` suppression reason. The MCP server's send tool takes `tracking.unsubscribe`.
