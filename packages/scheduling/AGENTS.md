# packages/scheduling — Scheduling

Hosts, availability, calendars and bookings. A native engine with no runtime dependency on Cal.com:
pure logic (`engine/`) was ported from it with its test cases, and orchestration rewritten.

## The double-booking guarantee

`scheduling_claim_no_overlap` (a custom migration: drizzle can't declare it) refuses two claims of a host that
overlap in both occupied and live time. **It is the only enforcement**; slot lists and re-checks just avoid asking
it questions it would refuse.

- Only `claims.ts` writes claims. `DO NOTHING` means a lost slot leaves the transaction usable. `live_until` comes
  from the same SQL clock as `live_from`: an expiry passed in and already past raises `22000`, not a conflict.
- `occupied` is the booking plus its buffers (`occupiedRange`). Neighbours' buffers add up.
- An expired hold's live range has ended, so it blocks nobody. **No correctness depends on a sweeper**.
  `expireDueBookings` only tidies up and tells customers.
- Converting a hold sets `live_from` to now, or two dead holds on one slot would conflict.
- **Lock order is fixed**: an attendee's advisory locks (`checkAttendeeLimit`, sorted), hosts and memberships (sorted),
  limit buckets (sorted), the group session, then claims by host. Unsorted collective bookings deadlocked about half the time on real Postgres. Bookers take `key share` on
  memberships, because the fairness counter's update would deadlock with `share`; a removal takes `update`.
- Limits count live claims under a bucket's row lock, and capacity counts seats under the session's. No counters to
  drift. A hold is a `held` booking, so conversion is one compare-and-set on one row.
- Anything that retries in a savepoint goes through `inSavepoint` (`claims.ts`), never drizzle's nested `transaction`:
  that one rolls back without releasing, so each failed attempt nests deeper and keeps a transaction id lock until
  commit. On a 500-host pool that ran Postgres out of lock table (`53200`), which is shared by the whole server.
- A group session has one claim, and every change to it happens under the session's lock, conversions included:
  firm while a seat is confirmed, otherwise as long as the latest live reservation, gone with the last live seat. A
  conversion counts the other seats first, because an expired hold's seat may have been taken. An expired approval
  gives up its seat like an expired hold.
- `deleteHost` refuses while a `held` or `pending_approval` booking has that host, expired or not. The cascade takes the
  host's `scheduling_booking_host` and claim rows together, so a collective booking can't tell afterwards that it lost
  one: a conversion can only catch a booking with no hosts at all.

An audit in `test/bookings.test.ts` checks every live booking holds exactly one claim per host.

## Routing

`candidatesOf` (`availability.ts`) is the one answer to who could take a booking, for slots, search, booking and moving
a booking: named hosts, plus a pool's `host_filter` matches right now, narrowed by `attributes`, and it never falls back
to someone who doesn't match. A row in `scheduling_event_type_host` with `assigned = false` only counts bookings for a
host a filter found, and never makes them a member. A host taken off `hosts` by name stays out whatever the filter says.
A pool's `required` hosts need a member: if narrowing leaves none, nobody's offered, rather than the required host alone.
A booker session's `attributes` come from the customer's server and are encrypted, since with an attendee they can say
what someone needs; the browser never sees them or sends its own.

## Slots

`isBookable` is the one definition of "can this be booked": listing and booking both call it, so they can't disagree.
The grid depends only on the zone and step, never on `now`, a window or busy time.

Time is computed **only in Bun services** (api, worker), with `engine/time.ts`: runtimes ship different tz data, and
`PUBLISHED_TRANSITIONS` covers what they may not carry yet. Node 22 and Bun 1.4.2 disagreed by an hour on Vancouver
when this was written. Never compute slots in the dashboard or with SQL's `AT TIME ZONE`: the dashboard's preview
embeds the booker. Local dates (overrides, limits) never pass through `Date`.

The booking path computes slots, so the dashboard (Node) never calls `createBooking` or `rescheduleBooking`. It opens the
hosted page in a tab through a session with `createdByUserId` (`openBookerAction`, `openBookingManagerAction`), and that
session acts as the member (`sessionActor`), past attendees' cutoffs. A manage session made this way lasts an hour.
`listRescheduleSlots` answers where a booking can move the way `rescheduleBooking` checks it: its own hosts (none disabled
or taken off the event type), length and buffers, with its own claims left out. Change them together.
A new event type field goes in the dashboard's form too
(`apps/web/src/lib/scheduling-edit.ts`, `event-type-form.tsx`), or typecheck fails on the test fixtures there.

## Calendars

- `CalendarClient` can't return a title: no method reads anything but busy intervals, and `scheduling_busy_interval`
  has no column for it. Google's scopes are least privilege, and Graph's `$select` is what keeps titles out, since it
  has no narrower read scope. CalDAV objects arrive whole: `ical.ts` parses times and drops the rest.
- **A calendar that errored is left out of `fetchBusy`'s result, and never reads as free**. Cal.com's CalDAV adapter
  got this wrong for a deleted calendar. `calendarVerdict` decides how long old data is trusted.
- **A CalDAV read with anything missing is a failed read**: an object that can't be parsed, a failed `propstat`, a
  truncated or cut-off multistatus. Time is unknowable there. A rule that's only expensive (too dense, impossible,
  malformed) has a known start and end, so it's expanded up to `MAX_CYCLES_PER_EVENT`/`MAX_OCCURRENCES_PER_EVENT` and
  the rest of its span counts as busy: one odd event shouldn't stale a whole calendar. Spending
  `MAX_CYCLES_PER_READ` fails the read, so a hostile server can only hide its own host. Expansion is synchronous, and
  `ical.js` can loop forever inside `next()` (`FREQ=DAILY;BYMONTH=2;BYMONTHDAY=30`), so `ical.ts` counts cycles by
  wrapping `check_contracting_rules`: re-check that when bumping the pinned version.
- A push only sets `dirty_at`. The leased `scheduling-calendar-sync` loop reads, fenced on `last_fetch_started_at`, so
  a slow older fetch can't overwrite a newer one.
- `scheduling_calendar_event` is desired state: the worker converges on the latest, so create, move and cancel can't
  reorder. A key makes a retry after a lost answer harmless (Google's client-chosen `id`, Graph's extended property
  plus `transactionId`, CalDAV's `If-None-Match`, Zoom's `agenda` marker); iCalUID doesn't do this on Google.
  `createEvent` leaves the event as asked even if a lost attempt made it, since the booking may have moved since, and
  a row with no `provider_event_id` is cancelled with `deleteEventByKey`.
- A write's `lease_until` is its fencing token (`stillHeld`): each row renews before its request, and only the holder
  records anything. Fencing can't recall a request on the wire, so a worker that finds it lost the row after sending
  bumps `desired_version` (`redrive`), and the row is written again from the latest state. Requests time out well
  inside the lease (`requestTimeoutMs`). What's left: a worker that dies with a request in flight can't re-drive, so
  that request can land last unnoticed, and CalDAV's 15 s timeout only covers an idle socket.
- A ledger row belongs to a booking or a group session, never a seat: a session has one event, from its first confirmed
  seat to its last, and news about it (`location_ready`, `external_conflict`, `calendar_write_failed`) goes to each
  confirmed seat. `scheduling_group_session.location` is where a session meets and `meeting_url` the link a provider
  made, gone with the event; a seat's own `location` is never read (`withSessionLocation`, `group-sessions.ts`), and
  since others see it, a booker's browser or an attendee's own number can't fill it in. A session's event that was
  deleted comes back as a new row, because its key can't be used twice.
- `freeBusy` carries no identity, so our own events are subtracted at read time. Limit, documented for customers: a
  foreign event wholly inside a booking's written event can't be detected.
- Host-supplied CalDAV URLs go through `pinnedDavTransport` (public addresses only, pinned against rebinding). Every
  URL a server names, in a redirect or a discovery answer, is checked in `send` before credentials go on it: the host's
  own origin, or between iCloud's `caldav` and `pNN-caldav` hosts (`isICloudCalDav`). That rule never skips the transport.
- Credentials use `encryptSecret` with `WEBHOOK_SECRETS_KEY`, never `SCHEDULING_DATA_KEYS`; `reencryptWebhookSecrets`
  covers them. A refresh writes back under a row lock unless the row now holds a different refresh token (compared
  decrypted, since a re-encryption changes the ciphertext and not the token, and a one-time token just used can't be
  asked for again). A consent's `encrypted_code_verifier` uses the same ring and isn't covered: it lasts 10 minutes, so
  a consent in progress when an old key leaves just starts over.
- Coss.com never auto-cancels: an external conflict or a host editing an event is flagged, with a webhook.
- Zoom (`calendar/zoom.ts`) is a write-only calendar: a connection has one hidden calendar row, never read for busy
  times and never a `write_target`, and a booking's meeting is a row in the same ledger, so retries, moves and cancels
  are the same code. Zoom has no idempotency key, so `createEvent` looks for its own meeting first, by a hash of the
  key in its `agenda` (never by title and time, which would adopt someone else's meeting), listing `type=scheduled`,
  since `upcoming` is reported to drop `agenda`. Its refresh tokens
  work once and expire unused, so `clientFor` re-reads after a refused refresh and `refreshIdleZoomConnections` keeps
  idle ones alive. `notZoomMeeting()` keeps these rows out of what's subtracted from busy times. Losing Zoom never hides
  a host. The app's deauthorization event comes to `POST /scheduling/zoom/events`.

### Delegation

`calendar/delegation.ts`, `delegation-failures.ts`, `delegation-tokens.ts` (no database). An admin authorizes a domain
once, and every host on it gets their calendar with no consent screen.

- **Credentials are the customer's own**: a service account from their Cloud project, or a single-tenant Entra app. The
  provider confines either to that Workspace or tenant, so there's no domain ownership check. That argument only holds
  for customer-owned credentials: a coss.com-owned service account shared between customers would let any customer
  claim another's domain, so that needs a client ID per delegation first. A pasted key's `token_uri` is ignored, since
  it could send the signed assertion anywhere.
- **A delegated connection is an ordinary connection** (`delegation_id` set), so sync, writes, channels and
  availability don't branch: only `clientFor` does. `encrypted_credentials` caches its access token (`refreshToken:
  null`), per mailbox. A delegation's credentials go only in `scheduling_calendar_delegation`, through `encryptSecret`.
- **The mailbox is stamped when a host connects** (`accountId`), and `email` changing later moves nothing, since it's
  "never an identity". Otherwise old events are orphaned, and a new connection has no write target. A host has one
  delegated mailbox, even if their email moves to another delegation's domain. Only `calendar_account` moves it
  (`releaseOldMailbox`, `hosts.ts`), refused while bookings are live or a write that may have reached the provider is still owed, under the host's lock. `hostStillWants` takes that
  lock and the delegation's before anything fetched is committed, and re-reads both: a mailbox changed or
  `match_host_email` turned off during the provider calls has to win. Locks: host, then delegation, then connections;
  a bulk flip takes the delegation, then connections, so nothing may lock a delegation after a connection. `match_host_email`
  trusts `host.email`, which the docs warn about: a customer taking emails from end users must turn it off.
- **`runDueCalendarDelegations`** connects a batch per run. `connectHost` fetches everything first (calendars, a
  channel, the first read) and commits it all in one transaction, so a host goes from no calendar to a verified one,
  never hidden or empty. A push can't find a channel that isn't stored yet, so the calendar is read once more straight
  after. Before activating it takes the delegation's row `FOR SHARE`, or it could land just after a bulk flip to
  `delegation_failing` and escape the outage. Delegations are claimed one at a time, and a lease is fenced. A delegation with hosts left runs again at once, walking
  them with a cursor that moves past every host it tried, however that went, so hosts that keep failing can't hold up
  the ones behind them; `nudgeDelegations` asks for a run
  when a host is created or changed.
- **Taking over an OAuth row** matches only on the account, keeping calendars, write target and ledger. A calendar in
  common proves nothing: a personal account can subscribe to a work calendar, and would get the wrong credentials. Never revoke the old token: Google's revoke drops all of the project's tokens for that person,
  which could be another host's. `saveConnection` leaves a delegated row alone, or a host's consent would replace the
  delegation's token, and its upsert checks that again under its own lock, since a takeover in progress isn't visible
  before it. `markNeedsReauth` re-reads the row, so a late failure of the old tokens does nothing.
- **Losing access**: every `auth` failure goes through `handleAccessLost`. Any refusal may be old, from a request already on its way,
  so nothing acts on one without asking again: before anything flips the credentials stored now are tried, and the flip
  is conditional on them still being stored; before a mailbox is marked, it's asked again too, and the same goes for
  that mark.
  Refused credentials flip every connection to `delegation_failing` in one update (compare-and-set on the delegation: one webhook, log line and owner email), so
  every `status = 'active'` filter works with no join in the availability path, and one update brings them back. On
  the wire that status is `needs_reauth`. One mailbox gone only marks that connection, with no email to the host, who
  can't fix it, and only after that mailbox has been asked again with today's credentials. Graph's 403 can't say which,
  so `probeDelegation` asks about up to three mailboxes: a person leaving
  must not hide everyone, including when they're the verified one. With no other mailbox to ask it can't tell, and
  counts as the delegation's, so someone hears. An inconclusive probe changes nothing and backs off.
- **Tokens outlive a revocation** by up to an hour: Google's and Entra's tokens aren't recalled. A delegated client
  raises `auth` for what a revocation looks like (Graph's inner `$batch` 401/403, Google's `insufficientPermissions`),
  or it'd pass as a failed read or a permanent write failure.
- **A mailbox never reached still hides its host**: its connection gets a stand-in calendar row, since availability reads
  health through calendars and with none the host reads as free. `connectHost` replaces it, and gives it a write target
  if it turns out to be the primary. An email correction releases such a connection (`releaseUnreachedMailbox`): it
  has no events, and it's the only mailbox change that doesn't need `calendar_account`. `reached_at` is what says it was
  never reached: `verified_at` isn't, since toggling `read_busy` clears it.
  The same goes for hosts it hasn't connected when access is lost, or who are added during an outage
  (`hideUnconnectedHosts`), who are tried again as soon as it's back. A stand-in isn't shown on the wire or selectable.
- **Deleting** is `deleting`, then the worker, within a run's budget: each connection released (details scrubbed,
  channels stopped), then removed with the host locked `FOR UPDATE`, or a booking reading its write target would hit a foreign key. Hosts stay bookable with no conflict
  check (the dialog and docs say so), as with any disconnect.
- Bookers' live check and sync need no changes. Provider behaviour the fakes can't prove (granular scopes under
  domain-wide delegation, Graph ids matching between `/me` and `/users/{id}`, app-only subscriptions and Teams links)
  needs checking against a real Workspace and tenant when any of this changes.

A Meet or Teams link becomes a `link` location on the booking, stored with `conference` (stripped from the wire), so a
new host gets a meeting of their own (`locationForNewHost`). A browser only chooses among an event type's `locations`
(`locationFromBrowser`): it can't supply its own link or address.

A `link`, `phone` or `in_person` location left blank takes the value of the booked host's `locations`, once a host has
won (`withHostLocation`), and stays blank if they have none: nobody loses availability over it. It's stored with
`fromHost` (stripped from the wire, like `conference`), so a move to another host never keeps the old host's office. A
booking is a snapshot: editing a host only reaches new bookings. Hosts set these themselves from their page, and they
land in attendees' emails, so `hosts.ts` refuses links in addresses and screens new addresses and URLs; a phone number
is E.164, with no room to say anything. An event type's own locations get the same checks when set. Links must be
https, but a booking can hold an older one, so `Where` (`apps/scheduling`) never puts anything but a web link in an `href`.

## Sessions and the client API

`sessions.ts`: a token (`cossch_`) stored only as a sha256, in the URL's fragment then an `Authorization` header, never
a cookie, path or query. A manage link says what it can do, expires, and stops on cancel: unlike Cal.com's booking
`uid`, which was a permanent credential. `apps/api/src/routes/scheduling-client.ts` is what browsers call, including
coss.com's own pages (`apps/scheduling`), so there's no private endpoint. Preflights are open because the bearer token
is the only authority; real requests are checked against `allowed_origins`. What a session returns is narrowed: an
attendee sees times, never other hosts.

## Personal data

- Attendee contact details and answers, and a booker session's fixed attendee, are encrypted with
  `SCHEDULING_DATA_KEYS`. Only `email_hmac` is searchable. A new column on this ring goes in
  `SCHEDULING_DATA_KEY_COLUMNS` and `reencryptSchedulingData` (a test compares the list with the database).
- Answers come back only from `getBooking`: never lists, webhooks, logs, emails or calendars. The dashboard's iOS
  routes map bookings to name or uid only (`scheduling/wire.ts` under `apps/web/src/app/api/mobile/v1`).
- Webhooks and log lines carry ids, times and statuses. `request-log.ts` keeps no bodies of these routes.
- Host calendar events are private, titled "Appointment", with no attendees, unless the event type's
  `host_calendar_details` is `full`: then `calendar/details.ts` adds its title, and who's coming to the title and
  description. Nobody's ever invited through a provider (Graph can't be stopped from emailing them), answers never go
  there, a group session's event has only the title, and Zoom stays neutral (`detailedEvent`, `writes.ts`). HIPAA mode
  refuses `full` at setup, and is read again at each write.
- A provider's copy of someone's details has to go when ours does. `details_written` marks a row whose event may say
  more than "Appointment", and `scrub_pending` says details have to come off it.
- `detailsToSend` takes `FOR SHARE` on the organization and the attendee rows, then sets the mark, in one transaction:
  a plain read wouldn't wait for an uncommitted erasure or HIPAA enablement, and would send what they're removing. So
  erasures and redaction change the attendee rows **before** calling `rewriteDetailedEvents`, in one transaction, and
  `enableHipaaMode` updates the organization's row before its rewrite. The ledger row is locked last, or these deadlock.
- A write clears both flags only if `desired_version` hasn't moved since it started (`clearedUnlessNewer`), and a stale
  writer that sent details sets both again (`redrive`). A row with `scrub_pending` never gives up: it retries with capped
  backoff and reports to Sentry once, until the write lands or the provider says the event is gone. Never work out
  "is this a cleanup?" from what the event will say: erasing the attendee leaves a guest in the description.
- `description` is left out of writes to an event that never held details, so what a host wrote there stays.
- Known limit: disconnecting and deleting a delegation scrub what they can within a budget before access goes
  (`scrubDetailedEvents`, which can't stop either), and deleting a host, moving a delegated host's `calendar_account`
  or a host revoking access at the provider scrubs nothing. Those copies are
  out of reach, and the docs say so.
- A guest is a `scheduling_attendee` with `role = 'guest'`, only an email and optional name, and the attendee's zone and
  locale; `participants` lists the attendee first. The event type's `max_guests` (default 0, never on `group`) allows
  them, since each is an address someone typed that we then email. So in live environments they're only emailed from the
  customer's own `email_from`, never coss.com's, even when it stops being verified (`ownSenderOnly`). They get no manage link and no SMS, and hear nothing until a booking's
  confirmed (`guestsAreTold`, `notifications.ts`). Their emails say nothing the booker wrote. The booker
  and manage pages and the iOS app see only the attendee; a host's portal sees everyone on their own bookings. With no `uid`, a guest is erased by address (`POST /scheduling/attendees/erase`):
  never put the address in a path or the audit log.
- `redactExpiredBookings` erases details 90 days after a booking ends, `purgeExpiredBookings` the row at 395;
  `eraseAttendee` on request, which also ends booker sessions fixed to them (found by `attendee_uid`). Periods live in
  `@coss/retention`.

## Notifications

`notifications.ts` resolves policy once, into outbox rows in the deciding transaction: core code never branches on it.
Rows hold no content; a row's rendered at send time and dropped if stale. A change that keeps a booking's time but
bumps its version (a location, a meeting link) calls `carryReminders`, or its reminder would look stale. Booking emails use `@coss/email-layout` with
no customer HTML and no links but the manage link, and pass `screeningExempt`: per-email screening would send patients'
names to the AI Gateway. In exchange, text a customer controls is screened at setup (`screening.ts`) and can't hold a
link. Never add a free-form field to these emails without screening it. SMS goes through `@coss/sms`, so it's sampled
as usual: keep names out of it.

Branding only applies under the customer's own `email_from`: `renderMessage` puts their name or logo and accent in
`html`, and `cossHtml`, what coss.com's address sends, has none of them. `scheduling_logo` holds a PNG or JPEG checked
by its bytes (`parseLogo`), never SVG. Emails carry it inline (`cid:`) and pages get it as a data URL from `/session`:
neither loads a remote image, since a request per open would say who's whose patient. A logo can't be screened like
text, and it can't hold a link.

## Billing

One `scheduling.bookings` unit per confirmed booking, series occurrence or group session, guarded by a compare-and-set
on `usage_recorded_at` (`recordUsage` doesn't dedupe). `reserve` runs after a host has won. Holds and pending approvals
aren't charged; reschedules are free; cancelled stays charged.

## Testing

`test/bookings.test.ts` races on real Postgres. `test/engine-differential.test.ts` compares `buildAvailability` with
fixtures generated from Cal.com's `buildDateRanges`; the one intended difference is that Cal.com's overrides can spill
outside the requested window. `FakeGoogleCalendarApi` (`./testing`) echoes writes back as busy, as the real one does, and checks a service account's
signature (`testServiceAccount`); `FakeGraphApi` only answers `/users/{mailbox}` paths, so a client left on `/me` shows.

`bun run --cwd apps/worker scheduling:load` (`--hosts 500 --days 14 --concurrency 32 --bookings 500 --existing 20 --busy
10 --searches 30 --races 20 --big-table-rows 5000`, `--sandbox`, `--capped`) measures search, slots and booking on the
test database: the package's own functions, in one process, with no API and no provider calls. By default a live
environment on the Pro plan; `--capped` adds a usage cap, which makes every booking update one quota row. Pool size:
`DATABASE_POOL_MAX`. It exits 1 if a race didn't have the winners it should or anything failed unexpectedly, and prints
`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` of the statements the hot paths really sent, flagging selective sequential scans of big
tables. A pool tries its top candidate, then reads who could still take the slot and tries only them, so a slot nobody can
take costs one attempt and one read rather than an attempt per host. A series on a pool of more than three reads first
too: everyone free for all of it, or with `skip` the three with the fewest conflicts. Loops over hosts call `takeTurn`,
since slots are computed on the API's one thread.

`bun run db:seed` adds demo hosts, event types and bookings around today to `acme`'s environments
(`scripts/seed.ts`).

## Going live

Live in production at `cossbook.com` (README, "Scheduling's hosted pages"). Without `SCHEDULING_DATA_KEYS` in a stage
secret, Scheduling is off there: the API answers 503 `scheduling_unavailable`, the worker's loops don't run and the
dashboard's pages don't exist. Rotating the key: README, "Rotating `SCHEDULING_DATA_KEYS`" (`bun run
scheduling:reencrypt`). Still to do:

1. Zoom's app review. The app "coss.com" is in Cal.com's Zoom developer account, separate from Cal.com's own, and
   production runs its Production credentials. Until it's approved, only reviewers and that Zoom account can consent.
2. A BAA before any customer holds PHI. The Terms prohibit it without a written agreement, and
   HIPAA mode (`packages/compliance/AGENTS.md`) is what such a customer gets.
- The dashboard reads one booking through `getBookingOverview`, which never returns answers (only `getBooking` does). Its `lookupKey` is the API's `RISK_HASH_KEY`, because `email_hmac` is searched with it.
