    /// Sends a one-time code to a phone number (SMS) or an email address and returns the verification, `pending` until you check the code the end user typed (`POST /v1/verifications/check`). Starting again for the same destination while it is pending sends a new code (the earlier one stops working), up to 5 times. Before a new verification costs anything, the fraud guard checks it (your Risk lists, premium-rate numbers, Tor, and velocity per IP, user, number range and country, with how often their codes are entered): a blocked one is stored with its `reasons` and nothing is sent. Pass the end user's `ip` (and your `user_id`) so it can tell them apart. SMS codes come from coss.com's shared numbers unless the environment's Verify settings name one of your own; email codes from your sender, else coss.com's. Sandbox (`coss_test_…`) keys deliver nothing and the code is always zeros.
