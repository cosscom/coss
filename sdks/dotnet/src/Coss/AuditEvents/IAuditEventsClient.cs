    /// The organization's audit log, newest first: changes made by members in the dashboard, by API keys (from any environment) and by coss.com support. The audit log is organization-wide, so every key of the organization reads the same events. Filter by action (an entry ending in `.` matches a whole resource, e.g. `domain.`), actor, target, environment or time. Pass the last `id` as `after` to get the next page while `has_more` is true. Reading the audit log is not itself logged.
