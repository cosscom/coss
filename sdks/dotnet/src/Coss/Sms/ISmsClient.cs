    /// Queues a text message from the API key's environment and returns it with `status: "queued"`; it is handed to the carrier moments later. Follow it with `GET /v1/sms/{id}` or the `sms.sent`, `sms.delivered`, `sms.undelivered` and `sms.failed` webhooks. Live (`coss_live_…`) keys send `from` one of the organization's numbers whose carrier registration is approved, to the countries the organization allows (US and Canada unless changed in the dashboard). Sandbox (`coss_test_…`) keys accept any `from`, deliver nothing and answer the SMS simulator's numbers (`+15005550006` delivered, `+15005550001` invalid, `+15005550004` filtered by the carrier, `+15005550009` opted out, `+15005550008` replies). A number on the environment's SMS suppression list (it replied STOP, or it can't receive SMS) is skipped: the message is `failed` with `suppressed`. Segments count against the organization's send quota, and each is billed by the destination country.
