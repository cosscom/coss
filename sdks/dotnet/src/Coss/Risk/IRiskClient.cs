    /// <summary>
    /// Assesses a sign-up, login or other event in the API key's environment and returns a decision (`allow`, `review` or `block`) with a score and the reasons behind it. coss.com combines email and IP signals with what it has seen in this environment (velocity, accounts sharing a mailbox, identifiers you reported) and your allow and block lists. Signals that are unavailable at the moment are skipped and listed in `degraded`. Call it from your server, never from the browser, and treat errors as `allow` (fail open) so an outage never locks your users out. `review` decisions also fire a `risk.assessment.review` webhook. Sandbox (`coss_test_…`) keys accept documented test addresses (`192.0.2.x`, `@disposable.test`, `@undeliverable.test`).

    /// Email intelligence on its own: syntax, disposable domains, whether the domain can receive mail (DNS), role accounts, free providers, the canonical mailbox, typo suggestions and the domain's age (RDAP). Stateless: nothing is stored or counted, so it never flags an address for having been seen before (assessments do). Failed lookups are listed in `degraded`. Sandbox keys see the documented test domains (`@disposable.test`, `@undeliverable.test`, `@new.test`).

Stateless. A failed lookup is reported in `degraded`. Each live check that gets an answer is billed (`risk.phone_checks`; plans include some every month, and Free stops at its allowance); invalid numbers, failed lookups and sandbox checks are free. Limited per organization as well as per key. Sandbox keys see the fictional numbers `+1 202 555 01xx` (`0101` landline, `0102` non-fixed VoIP, `0103` fixed VoIP, `0104` a recent SIM swap, `0199` invalid, the rest mobile).

Returns scores only: you decide what they mean. Neither the text nor the scores are stored, and request logs keep no body for this endpoint. Takes up to 3 seconds; a failure is a 503 you can retry or treat as unknown. Limited per organization as well as per key. Sandbox keys use markers instead of a model: `[coss-test:phishing]` scores 0.99, `[coss-test:spam:0.4]` exactly 0.4, everything else 0.01.
